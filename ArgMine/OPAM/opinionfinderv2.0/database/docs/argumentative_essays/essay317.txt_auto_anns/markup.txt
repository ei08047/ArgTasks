<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Every experience always gives us something to learn and keep for life

I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled, improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking, eating, etc., but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, when they tried to learn walking, they stumble and hurt themselves many times.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No known scientist has success in first attempt.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So, all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time, but when we think back about those moments later in life, we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When I moved to college hostel after school, first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted, but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I also became more casual and social with others, this experience increased my communication <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">skill</MPQAPOL> and social speaking <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">skills</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Therefore</MPQAPOL>, to conclude my <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">opinion</MPQAPOL> on this statement, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">want</MPQAPOL> to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">good</MPQAPOL> or <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">bad</MPQAPOL> always gives us something to learn and keep for life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Good</MPQAPOL> experiences give us <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">good</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">memories</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">bad</MPQAPOL> ones teach us lessons for life.</MPQASENT>
