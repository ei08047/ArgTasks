<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gun control and increasing violence

Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To some extent, I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all, it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, this is not as simple as it sounds.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In fact, stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a result, the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, if a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, criminal mind seems to be more related to violence.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Consequently</MPQAPOL>, we <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> pay more attention to adjust people's behaviors in order to reduce <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">crimes</MPQAPOL> instead of gun control.</MPQASENT>
