<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Factor of choosing a career.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In many societies, choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nevertheless, while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor, I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To begin with, I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, aspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">People, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In this sense, it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Further and even more importantly, most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In other words, career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, people, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">disagree</MPQAPOL> with the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">idea</MPQAPOL> that salary outweighs any other motivators, as there are other <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">even</MPQAPOL> more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">important</MPQAPOL> aspects <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">such</MPQAPOL> as: <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">friendly</MPQAPOL> co-workers, working conditions and professional <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">achievements</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
