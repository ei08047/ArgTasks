<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Taking a break before starting higher education is a good idea

Nowadays, it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Students take a break of year or two, some students travel all around the world during this time, and some choose to take up a job.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Experience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Student's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Once student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my view point, I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Students who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They tend to contribute more due to their <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">real</MPQAPOL> world experiences which makes them more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">mature</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
