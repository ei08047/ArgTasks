<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Every student either male or female should be given equal opportunity
 
In today's context, education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one's future.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In my personal opinion, I am totally agreed with the view that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To begin with, judging student's skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Nowadays, both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore, female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition, due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, Chanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, I am <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">firmly</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">supporting</MPQAPOL> the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">view</MPQAPOL>, that every student either male or female <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be given <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">fairly</MPQAPOL> equal <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">opportunity</MPQAPOL> to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> meet the required qualifications <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">rather</MPQAPOL> than putting <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">limitations</MPQAPOL> based on their gender.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Government <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> take interim measures, to regulate <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">admission</MPQAPOL> process for university courses which <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">enables</MPQAPOL> every student to get <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">benefit</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
