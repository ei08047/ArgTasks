<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some celebrities misguide young people& some guide them in right direction

Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation, this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For example, some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media, thereby gaining the public attention.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If they continue to behave in such a way, it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Consequently, the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nevertheless, I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Firstly, celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Secondly, other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Take Michael Jackson as an example, his works are widely spread around the world, and have been <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">extremely</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">welcomed</MPQAPOL> by the younger generation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His songs spread the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">idea</MPQAPOL> that people <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">care</MPQAPOL> about each other, which <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">suggests</MPQAPOL> to young people how to become a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">good</MPQAPOL> member of society.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In summary, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">although</MPQAPOL> some <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">celebrities</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">misguide</MPQAPOL> young people by <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">showing</MPQAPOL> their external wealth and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">appearance</MPQAPOL>, other <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">celebrities</MPQAPOL> do lead young people in the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">right</MPQAPOL> direction.</MPQASENT>
