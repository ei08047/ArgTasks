<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Successful people try new things and take risks

I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people, you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I do believe that great success requires taking great risks.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you want to gain very high profits in investments, you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam, you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The more you take <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">risks</MPQAPOL>, the greater your <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">successes</MPQAPOL> will be.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If you don’t take any <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">risks</MPQAPOL>, you will have an ordinary life with average <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">successes</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That’s why it is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">important</MPQAPOL> to take <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">risks</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In sum, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">believe</MPQAPOL> that <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">success</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">trying</MPQAPOL> new things and taking <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">risks</MPQAPOL> go hand in hand and to <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">achieve</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">success</MPQAPOL> you <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">consider</MPQAPOL> them.</MPQASENT>
