<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Young people move to cities

These days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Personally, I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To begin with, the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Obviously, many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a result, cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Additionally, it might put strain on the environment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">opinion</MPQAPOL>, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">however</MPQAPOL>, I do not <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">approve</MPQAPOL> of this trend due to <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">negative</MPQAPOL> effects <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">such</MPQAPOL> as <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">low</MPQAPOL> quality of life and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">affecting</MPQAPOL> the environment.</MPQASENT>
