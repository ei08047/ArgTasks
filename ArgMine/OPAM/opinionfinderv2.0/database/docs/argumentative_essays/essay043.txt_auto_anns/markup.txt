<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Sporting events easing international tensions, releasing patriotic feelings

For most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Firstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Secondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This has been <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">true</MPQAPOL> for centuries and will <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">certainly</MPQAPOL> not change in the foreseeable future.</MPQASENT>
