<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Traditional games or modern games in developing children's skills

Games have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In such case, the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children's developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is true that modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, I think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As a result, communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In fact, these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By contrast, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Thus</MPQAPOL>, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> conclude that <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">traditional</MPQAPOL> games <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be, by no means, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">ignored</MPQAPOL> by parents and teachers with the advent of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">modern</MPQAPOL> games.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Only through <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">traditional</MPQAPOL> games can children be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">ensured</MPQAPOL> a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">positive</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">healthy</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">skills</MPQAPOL> learning process.</MPQASENT>
