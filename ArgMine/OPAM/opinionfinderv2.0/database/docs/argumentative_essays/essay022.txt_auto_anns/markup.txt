<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Young people should go to university or not

Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In this essay, I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are in short supply.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">More importantly, many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, I agree with the latter view.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Although</MPQAPOL> higher education does not <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">guarantee</MPQAPOL> young students' <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">success</MPQAPOL>, the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">benefits</MPQAPOL> of learning in universities are the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">vital</MPQAPOL> factor in creating more <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">possibilities</MPQAPOL> for the development of society through advancing academic <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">fulfillment</MPQAPOL> and the young generation who have experiences and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">challenges</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
