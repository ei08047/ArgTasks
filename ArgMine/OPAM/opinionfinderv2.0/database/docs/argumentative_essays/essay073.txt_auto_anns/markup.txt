<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Is image more powerful than the written word?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">"A picture is worth a thousand words" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, pictures can influence the way people think.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Looking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hence, for a more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">meaningful</MPQAPOL> communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">particular</MPQAPOL> subject.</MPQASENT>
