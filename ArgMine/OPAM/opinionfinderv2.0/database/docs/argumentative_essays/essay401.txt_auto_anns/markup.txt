<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth

In today's world, having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families, the smallest component of the society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While mother's role is essential in a child's life, I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The first reason why the father's role should be equal to the mother's role is the nature of parantage.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In my view, the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child's characteristics.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For example, in a traditional Turkish family, while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child, a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life, including relationships.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For instance, a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today's society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Instead, all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Therefore</MPQAPOL>, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">believe</MPQAPOL> that having and raising children <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> not be different than any other daily activity.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, fatherhood <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth due to providing <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">appropriate</MPQAPOL> parenthood and having <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">healthy</MPQAPOL> family relationships.</MPQASENT>
