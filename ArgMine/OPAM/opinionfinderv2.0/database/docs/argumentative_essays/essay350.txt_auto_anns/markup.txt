<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines

Digital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With this advancement, newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But many other still thinks they are going to stay.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, when the aircraft MH 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In such situations, newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Instead of waiting for next publication, people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research, satisfy interest, etc.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To conclude, the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">fast</MPQAPOL> responding internet media with <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">vast</MPQAPOL> information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">valid</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Though</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">considering</MPQAPOL> the current infrastructure and mindset of people, paper media will continue for another few years.</MPQASENT>
