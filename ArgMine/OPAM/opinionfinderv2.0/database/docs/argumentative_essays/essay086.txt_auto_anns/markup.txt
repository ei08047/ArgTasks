<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nowadays living is possible on every place of the world, but still there are some differences among them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From my point of view big cities can be a good place for bringing up children.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To begin with, it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For instance, in my country the best schools, universities and institutes are located in cities, and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children's life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What is more, it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example playgrounds, parks, science museums, cinemas etc.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">However, in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Finally</MPQAPOL>, in <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">big</MPQAPOL> cities children access to media <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">easily</MPQAPOL>, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">so</MPQAPOL> they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world, therefor they can exchange their <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">knowledge</MPQAPOL>, they can learn different cultures.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To sum up, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">although</MPQAPOL> countrysides have some <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advantages</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">such</MPQAPOL> as <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">fresh</MPQAPOL> air, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">peace</MPQAPOL>, and etc.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Today's children <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">needs</MPQAPOL> somethings to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">entertain</MPQAPOL> them, and occupy their leisure time in the <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">best</MPQAPOL> way.</MPQASENT>
