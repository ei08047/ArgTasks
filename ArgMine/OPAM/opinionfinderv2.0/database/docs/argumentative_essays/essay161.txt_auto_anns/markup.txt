<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Leisure activities - Spend your free time outdoors or indoors.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">People often relax themselves by joining leisure activities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people prefer to spend their free time indoors.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But from my experience, I myself prefer to spend my leisure time outdoors because I strongly feel that it is good for health and keep my body fit.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Also, outdoor activities enable me to socialize with other people and enjoy natural beauty.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are strong advantages to spend leisure time outdoors.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One benefit is that doing outdoor activities such as soccer and baseball is good for one's health.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For instance, last year, I spent my summer time playing soccer and baseball.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Playing baseball provided my upper body for hitting and throwing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Soccer, on the other hand, developed my lower body for kicking and endurance for playing full 90-minute-games.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I belive that practicing these sports helped me greatly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Something else that is good is that playing these sports is to keep my body fit, make me ultimately refreshed.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After that summer, my body is stronger and endurance is better.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Outdoor activities not only improves my health but also gives me chances to communicate with more people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When I was ten years old, I was a shy girl.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">My mother took me to The National Camp.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At first, I just ate and played alone.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But on the third day, while I was swimming, a friendly girl came and greeted me, we became friend later and she taught me how to swim effectively.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the next day, we played together and she introduced me to her friends.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thanks to her and outdoor activities such as going skiing, climbing the mountain, I had a lot of friends since The National Camp.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If, for example, I hadn't participate in that camping, I wouldn't have had many friends like today.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, you can also enjoy the beautiful nature when doing some outdoor activities like going hiking, sunbathing, going biking.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you spend your spare time at home or something like that, you can't enjoy beautiful nature.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Spending time outdoors, people can breathe fresh air, feel the warm sun on their face and enjoy the complete peace that only nature brings.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Admittedly, indoor activities are fun.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There's no doubt that indoor activities like reading a book, watching TV or listening to music can bring us lots of joy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Although</MPQAPOL> I can also have fun in indoor activities, this <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advantage</MPQAPOL> cannot outweigh the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">attractions</MPQAPOL> coming from outdoor activities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After all, people are people and we have our own propensity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Leisure activities are one of them and I myself choose outdoor activities to spend my leisure time.</MPQASENT>
