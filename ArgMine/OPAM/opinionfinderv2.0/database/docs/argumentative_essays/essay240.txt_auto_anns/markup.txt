<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Most difficult experiences will become valuable lessons

There is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For that reason, some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, some people think it isn't supposed to be that case.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From my point of view, I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">To start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as, a shining weather, a delicious breakfast and etc.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a result, experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What's more, people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties, they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way.</MPQASENT>
