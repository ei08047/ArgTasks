<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Protect animals or not?</MPQASENT>
 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species, others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, we should give priority to our own issues.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On most occasions, the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore, human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, more emphasis <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be laid on human beings other than animals, and it is <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">better</MPQAPOL> to let <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">nature</MPQAPOL> take its course with <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">regard</MPQAPOL> to species extinction.</MPQASENT>
