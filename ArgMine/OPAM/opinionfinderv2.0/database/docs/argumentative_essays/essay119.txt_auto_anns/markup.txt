<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Computers replace human teachers

With the number of technological advances growing apace, it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This idea may point out to two main directions, both of which present different arguments.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information, which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge, ranging from visual to aural stimuli, which make learning an ever enjoyable experience, especially for children.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the other hand, critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable, there still remain certain shortcomings.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Much information as the Internet may provide, most of the sources are unjustified by experts.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a result, information from those sources is subject to question.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Admittedly, the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Through face-to-face communication, teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore, adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is where the computer proves to be incompetent.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In short, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">although</MPQAPOL> both sides have their equally <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">valid</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">arguments</MPQAPOL>, I am inclined to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">think</MPQAPOL> that <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">although</MPQAPOL> Internet can be a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">useful</MPQAPOL> tool for education, at no time will the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">unique</MPQAPOL> role of human teachers be replaced.</MPQASENT>
