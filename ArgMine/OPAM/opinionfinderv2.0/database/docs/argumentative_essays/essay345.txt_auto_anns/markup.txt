<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Working Extended hours should restricted

Working longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is a saying in my native village, "Health is Wealth".</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First of all, many of us would agree to the fact that people; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">By working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instance, I would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Recently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To conclude this, I would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This will <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">help</MPQAPOL> in uplift of society, and bring the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">lost</MPQAPOL> equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person.</MPQASENT>
