<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Television has more bad than good in respect of bonds with family and friends

There are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium, it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, from my point of view, television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To begin with, television shows make people forget what is really important.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus, they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show "Infinete Challenges".</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That is, watching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, even when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus, it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To illustrate my point, it is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don't require any participation.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is because television not only makes people be <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">obsessed</MPQAPOL> with it but also makes their mouth close.</MPQASENT>
