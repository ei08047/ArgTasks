<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Apartments vs dormitories at university

Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Both options have their advantages and disadvantages.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After considering the level of freedom, the studying conditions and the economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First, an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules, in the apartment you set your own rules.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Second, from an economic point of view, people often argue that an apartment is more expensive.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is only partially true, you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Transportation is another issue, you have to go to and return from the university everyday.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You could choose to use public transportation, a cheaper option, or to have a car.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The car is an expensive option, but also offers freedom of schedule and destination.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Lastly, the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don't have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since in an apartment you don't have a roommate, you won't have this problem, and as a result you would be able to concentrate better.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For the same <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reason</MPQAPOL>, you won't have a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">problem</MPQAPOL> if you are the one who <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">wants</MPQAPOL> to play music, bring <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">friends</MPQAPOL> over, or study late at night.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You set your own schedules.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the other hand, living in a dormitory, and being surrounded by students also has some <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advantages</MPQAPOL>, like being <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">able</MPQAPOL> to get <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">help</MPQAPOL> with any academic issues from them.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To conclude, both options have their <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advantages</MPQAPOL>, but personally I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">think</MPQAPOL> the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advantages</MPQAPOL> of living in an apartment <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">outshine</MPQAPOL> those of living in a dormitory.</MPQASENT>
