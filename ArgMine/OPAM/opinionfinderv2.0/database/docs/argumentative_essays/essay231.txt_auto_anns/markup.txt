<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Children should grow up in a big city!</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It’s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Of course you need to choose a good neighborhood.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I hold this belief because of two main reasons, academic and social reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some people thinks that if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game, but this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">My friends and I used to play soccer, bike, climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We did play video-games, but that wasn't our main activity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I have a friend that grew up in the countryside.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is another downside of growing up in the countryside.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience, you won’t know a lot of people, there are gossips everywhere, and your life will be really limited.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If someday I have children, I’m absolutely <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">sure</MPQAPOL> that they will grow up in a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">good</MPQAPOL> neighborhood of a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">big</MPQAPOL> city and they will be <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">very</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">happy</MPQAPOL> about it.</MPQASENT>
