<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Establishing a new university in your community

I will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies, creation of jobs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you would like to attend a business school, you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community's university.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Undoubtedly, the university will have to hire professors, employees and etc.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus, a number vacant positions need to be filled.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, when people have jobs, they will have money to spend on goods and services.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This can also help stimulate the local economy.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">However, building the university may lead to some social problems.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When many people congregate in one place, I think that some kinds of social problems will follow.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Traffic may worsen.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">More <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">wastes</MPQAPOL> have to be managed.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Maybe</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">crime</MPQAPOL> rate will also increase.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These social <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">problems</MPQAPOL> may <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">impair</MPQAPOL> the quality of life in the community.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In sum, I myself <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">agree</MPQAPOL> with the plan to build the university.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">believe</MPQAPOL> the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">benefit</MPQAPOL> from it will outweigh the cost.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">However</MPQAPOL>, it <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">indispensable</MPQAPOL> that the government conduct a survey about the community <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">opinion</MPQAPOL> on the new university first.</MPQASENT>
