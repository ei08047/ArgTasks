<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Businesses should be only concerned about making profits.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is no doubt that companies, factories and businesses establish to provide products which are people's need and make a profit for their managers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want, they will threaten the beings' life such as human, animals and plants.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit, they will produce products with low qualities and high prices, therefore they might hit consumer's life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For instance, a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk, sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, all companies, factories and businesses <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be monitored by governments and executive, and they do not have to let do anything they <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">want</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">just</MPQAPOL> due to making <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">profit</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They can hit both the environment and human's life <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">easily</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
