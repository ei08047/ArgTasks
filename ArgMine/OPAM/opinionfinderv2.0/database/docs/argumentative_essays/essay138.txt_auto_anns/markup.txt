<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Distance-learning cannot bring the benefits that traditional colleges offer
 
With the tremendous development in information technology, long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From my perspective, I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">To begin with, studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Besides that, long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">However</MPQAPOL>, distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">efficiency</MPQAPOL>, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose.</MPQASENT>
