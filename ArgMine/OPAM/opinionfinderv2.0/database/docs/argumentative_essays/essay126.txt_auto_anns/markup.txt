<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One or two close friends vs. a large number of casual acquaintances

There is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, I still agree that it's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First, it's not easy to make friend with anyone.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities, for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We spend time together but we could never be friend.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So, it's much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second, close friends can easily understand each others feelings.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Because of the similarity I talked before, acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, they wouldn't even spare time to consider your feelings.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When my friend is sick, I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail, I will try my best to pull him back, but not stand and stare like it's not of my business.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And I believe my friend will do the same to me.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, a friend is a person you care about.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To me, friends are the most important people in my life second to my family.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends, and I am fully content that I have such nice friends.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If someone exchange my <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">friends</MPQAPOL> with thousands of acquaintances, I will <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">definitely</MPQAPOL> say NO.</MPQASENT>
