<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Going to classes should be optional for the students

University students have different opinion about their attendance to class.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">According to my opinion, because it is university level of education, students have enough maturity to choose their choice.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To begin with, going to classes are sometimes waste of the time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For instance, some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Further, they didn't explain the contents in order to understand by the students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was waste of the time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Because the university students have grown up, they have enough ability to read and understand the text book.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, with the modern technology, students can collect more information from different sources.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, from the Internet, students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When the students attend that lectures, they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Additionally, mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Besides, most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Students need to work as part time basis.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hence, they have to schedule the lectures time, studying time and working time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At the same time, rather than attending any boring lecturers, students can participate to other activities such as debate competition, swimming meet, Basketball and so forth.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In a nutshell, although few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures, some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students' time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When the students go to university, they have matured mentally and physically.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Therefore</MPQAPOL>, to make use of time, if the students choose the classes as optional, it <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> provide more <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">benefits</MPQAPOL> than drawbacks.</MPQASENT>
