<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Old and young workers

Throughout human history, the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is still true in the industrial society nowadays, where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First and foremost, old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The old were raised in poverty, probably caused by war, look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change, or more precisely, to accept the existence of such modernity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human's capability.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Secondly, their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In other words, that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This, by all means, is outweigh by youngsters' adventurousness and bravery.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Blatantly seen, success of most companies stems from young people, whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Last but not least, knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Who would the employer choose, an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject, but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not to undermine old workers, but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All in a nutshell, workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">However</MPQAPOL>, in my <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">point</MPQAPOL> of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">view</MPQAPOL>, it is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">still</MPQAPOL> of <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">great</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">importance</MPQAPOL> to remain the <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">harmonious</MPQAPOL> coexistence of both sides for the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">smooth</MPQAPOL> sailing of the company.</MPQASENT>
