<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more

Nowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From my point of view although endangered animals are important, human needs should be considered more.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Firstly, day by day population is increasing, so human needs for food is increasing as well.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn, and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, farmlands are vital for human life.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Secondly, people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals, so they need land to build their houses on it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally, human need some crucial things to continue their life, and most of them are industrial such as medicine.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, some lands should be assigned to industry.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">To conclude, the population of endangered animals are less than people's population, so they do not need so much land that people need.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> maintain that nowadays humans <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">need</MPQAPOL> farmland, housing and industry because of increasing population are more <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">important</MPQAPOL> than saving land for <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">endangered</MPQAPOL> animals.</MPQASENT>
