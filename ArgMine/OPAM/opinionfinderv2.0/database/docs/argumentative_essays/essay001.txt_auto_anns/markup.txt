<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Should students be taught to compete or to cooperate?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The greater our goal is, the more competition we need.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Consequently</MPQAPOL>, no matter from the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">view</MPQAPOL> of individual development or the relationship between competition and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">cooperation</MPQAPOL> we can receive the same conclusion that a more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">cooperative</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">attitudes</MPQAPOL> towards life is more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">profitable</MPQAPOL> in one's <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">success</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
