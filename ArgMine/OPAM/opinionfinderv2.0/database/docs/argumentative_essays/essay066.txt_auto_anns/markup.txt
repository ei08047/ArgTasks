<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Technology keeps traditional skills and ways of life alive or not?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Living in the 21st century, people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus, every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years, regardless of any potential problems it may bring about.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, I believe their concern is groundless.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Instead, technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Additionally, technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In fact, many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the other hand, some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They argue that people, especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Therefore</MPQAPOL>, I will conclude that technology <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">indeed</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">supports</MPQAPOL> the preservation and promotion of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">traditional</MPQAPOL> techniques and lifestyles.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Only when <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">traditional</MPQAPOL> culture is integrated with the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">modern</MPQAPOL> technology can it be developed in the long run.</MPQASENT>
