<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Why are groups or organizations important to people?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">During our life, it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations; therefore, groups and organizations are an important part of their lives.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In my point of view, groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">My reasons include the following:
In the first place, humans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Most of all, the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus, almost of us live in the environment of groups.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, as a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">known</MPQAPOL> some <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">famous</MPQAPOL> artists during the term.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Above</MPQAPOL> all, it is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advantage</MPQAPOL> which increase an <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">opportunity</MPQAPOL> on my resume for the sake of getting a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">better</MPQAPOL> job.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Furthermore</MPQAPOL>, groups and organizations <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> lead people to take action or <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">achieve</MPQAPOL> their goal.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Here is an example: there are various <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">charities</MPQAPOL> in the world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Tzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">famous</MPQAPOL> for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">They bring <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">hopes</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">inspire</MPQAPOL> others with their <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">generous</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">spirit</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">accomplishing</MPQAPOL> their missions, the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">charity</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">difficult</MPQAPOL> tasks.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a result, they lit the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">light</MPQAPOL> for the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">poor</MPQAPOL> and victims; in addition, they <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">could</MPQAPOL> have chance to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">help</MPQAPOL> the people in <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">need</MPQAPOL> from all over the world.</MPQASENT>
