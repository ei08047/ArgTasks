<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Keep trying and never stop working for your goals

"Keep running!<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">," shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014, I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At some moment, my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From this experience, I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, committing to our goal helps creating personal worth.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even if I were not to win this medal, I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Secondly, one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, I did not give up, and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning, and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thirdly, at some point, we, as an average people, might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When the distance is longer and harder to achieve, a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For these reasons, I agree that one should not give up, as the true reward is to have the dignity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Anyone who <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">wants</MPQAPOL> to <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">achieve</MPQAPOL> the goal <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">acknowledge</MPQAPOL> that his effort and experience from <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">suffering</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">helps</MPQAPOL> him <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">understand</MPQAPOL> his <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">true</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">potential</MPQAPOL> and increase his <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">strength</MPQAPOL>, and <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">ultimately</MPQAPOL>, it will prompt him to be <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">ready</MPQAPOL> for <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">overcoming</MPQAPOL> the greater <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">challenge</MPQAPOL> in his life.</MPQASENT>
