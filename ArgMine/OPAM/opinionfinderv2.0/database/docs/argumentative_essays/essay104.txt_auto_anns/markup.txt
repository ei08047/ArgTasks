<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First and foremost, the Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As such, the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, with the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Last but not least, the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Critics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus, what we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study.</MPQASENT>
