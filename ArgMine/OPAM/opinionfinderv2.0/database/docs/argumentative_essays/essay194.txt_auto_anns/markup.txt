<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Should animals be free or live in zoos?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, like we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hence, when they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In addition to the previous point, various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For instance, I recall my first trip to a zoo, at age eight.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Moreover</MPQAPOL>, many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them.</MPQASENT>
