Nowadays, the Earth has become like a small village.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the course of the last hundred years, the way majority of people communicate with each other has been altered significantly because of technology.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But there are vast amount of disputes whether it is positive or negative.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From my point of view, this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To begin with, nowadays, to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present, it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By means of some software such as Skype, MSN, Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, in earlier times, people didn't leave for faraway places, because they could easily get lost.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Further, by means of some communication tools, it has become very easy to make new friends.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">According to statistics, 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this sense, Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, the other side of the coin is that, by communicating via Internet or phone, we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully, because during such conversations, some of our words can make a completely different sense.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a result, the rate of divorces is increasing day by day.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By way of conclusion, I once again restate my <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">position</MPQAPOL> that the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">very</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">positively</MPQAPOL> by making it <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">easier</MPQAPOL> and more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">comfortable</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
