<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One important thing that I want to change about my hometown

Public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In my hometown, there are almost complete public utilities for one’s needs but transportation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Since I’m facing the traffic congestion every day.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And this problem seem to get worst.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At first, it should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hence, people will have more ways to go to a place.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community, It makes people in this area have no choice.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They must take only a bus to go to another place.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Also, this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, the buses provide merely two routes in this community.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is absolutely a major problem.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Obviously, it is waste of time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lastly, having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Also, it provides many advantages.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instance, people can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The necessary energy will slowly be used up, since people use less their own cars.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To sum up, the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people’s living.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I wish one day this problem would be changed.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And then, the transportation in my hometown is no longer <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">difficult</MPQAPOL> for everyone in this community.</MPQASENT>
