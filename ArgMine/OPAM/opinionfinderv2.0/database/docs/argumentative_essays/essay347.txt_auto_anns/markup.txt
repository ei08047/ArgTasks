Nowdays, people's choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television, street, magazine etc.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, in most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition, products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, buying habit is a very personal things for individuals, the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy, sometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">On the other hand, children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not, since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, I think buying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">So</MPQAPOL> it is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">important</MPQAPOL> that government <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">needs</MPQAPOL> to <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">impose</MPQAPOL> rules on <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">particularly</MPQAPOL> advertisement company (for example, toys company) to <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">avoid</MPQAPOL> youngster have <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">bias</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">thought</MPQAPOL> on what they <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">really</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">need</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
