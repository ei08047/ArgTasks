<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mail

When it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email, I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Firstly, team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Obviously, discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official, therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While if the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Admittedly, sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since it is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While we should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">prefer</MPQAPOL> the project members to work in person <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">rather</MPQAPOL> them by email because work in person will be more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">efficient</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
