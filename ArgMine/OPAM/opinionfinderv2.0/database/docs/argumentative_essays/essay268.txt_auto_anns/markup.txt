<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Spending equal amount of money on libraries and sports?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">University students can be divided into two groups, one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Usually the second group's members do not have enough time to do exercise.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But I don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First, in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, my roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As you see, she is doing exercise without spending a cent.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition, students choose their major based on their interests.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Because their major in completely involved in physical activities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In contrast, for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally, spending money on social activities looks like wasting money.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, I do not <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">deny</MPQAPOL> the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">importance</MPQAPOL> of doing sports in the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">success</MPQAPOL> of university students, but I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">think</MPQAPOL> both sports and social activities <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories.</MPQASENT>
