<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all, a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Through those impressions, a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, I worked in a new company, if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well, my new colleagues will accept me, even then I will be approved by the employers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In opposite situation if I am being rude, I can not get along well with each other.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally, I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job.</MPQASENT>
