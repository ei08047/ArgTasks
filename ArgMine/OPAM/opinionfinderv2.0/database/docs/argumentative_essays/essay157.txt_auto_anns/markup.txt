<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gossip-based information

Nowadays information plays an important role in our world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It has become a product, which can be sold, bought, or stolen.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people say: "information is power".</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That's why it is so important to be well-informed.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Secondly, it is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations, because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts, especially in the internet, that's why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the "salt-panic" was over.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To conclude, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">want</MPQAPOL> to say that it is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">very</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">important</MPQAPOL> to be <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">confident</MPQAPOL> of the information, which you use, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">especially</MPQAPOL> when your conclusion or decision may have a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">great</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">influence</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
