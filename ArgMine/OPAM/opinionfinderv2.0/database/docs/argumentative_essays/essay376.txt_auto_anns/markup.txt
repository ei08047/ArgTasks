<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Prevention is better than cure

There has always been a saying in medicine: "Prevention is better than cure".</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What is more, it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To sum up, I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This will yield <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">positive</MPQAPOL> results on not only the people's physical and mental development but also their finance.</MPQASENT>
