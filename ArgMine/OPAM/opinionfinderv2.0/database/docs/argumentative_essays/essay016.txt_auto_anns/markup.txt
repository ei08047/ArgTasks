<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Using animals for the benefit of the human beings

With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Furthermore</MPQAPOL>, it also have potentially <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">harm</MPQAPOL> for human's health without any testing.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To sum up, I reaffirm that <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">although</MPQAPOL> there is some <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">disadvantages</MPQAPOL> of animals' <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">profits</MPQAPOL>, the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">merits</MPQAPOL> of animal experiments <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">still</MPQAPOL> outweigh the demerits.</MPQASENT>
