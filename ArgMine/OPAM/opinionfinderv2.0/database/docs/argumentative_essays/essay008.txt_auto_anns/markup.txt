<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">"Education is the investment in our future", as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out, education, which fosters a civilized society, plays a significant role in a country's long-lasting prosperity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">As for the two integral components within the system, elementary and advanced education, there's no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Concerning that elementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society, government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In other words, if countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That's not enough, for higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention, but this argument is invalid.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Researches into humanities and art <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">still</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">need</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">large</MPQAPOL> amount of money, what's more, government's <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">big</MPQAPOL> budget on universities may attract more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">excellent</MPQAPOL> intellectuals and researchers into the country and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">enjoy</MPQAPOL> a higher reputation worldwide.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL> listed <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">above</MPQAPOL>, we can safely draw the conclusion that, a government <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">spare</MPQAPOL> effort on young children education as <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">well</MPQAPOL> as universities, both are crucial on the way to a brighter future.</MPQASENT>
