<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Should governments be responsible to help the unemployed and homeless

Unemployment is clearly a global problem, be it in developed countries or developing ones.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Tax revenue is collected from those who works.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Besides, there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, so addressing unemployment should have low priority.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Also, it is obvious that, to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Of course, this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In this case, the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After all, it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, my <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">point</MPQAPOL> of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">view</MPQAPOL> is that, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">although</MPQAPOL> the government <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> provide <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">help</MPQAPOL> for the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">disadvantaged</MPQAPOL> people, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">direct</MPQAPOL> financial <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">support</MPQAPOL> may not be a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">wise</MPQAPOL> option and people <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> rely on themselves to get out of the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">adversity</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
