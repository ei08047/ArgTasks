<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">People who can’t accept others’ criticism can’t succeed in group working

In everyday life we encounter different people, and we receive different opinions about us or our works, no matter positive or negative.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It might be easy to take praises but hard to accept criticism.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, here goes the point that people who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Personally, I agree with this statement.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First, the core of group working is "consensus".</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It's the idea that everyone’s opinion accounts.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In group works, group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion, think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In this long process of discussion, there must be different opinions sparkling out.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It doesn't work if one member solely insists on his/her idea and doesn't take other member's criticism because the work belongs to every member, not a personal show for specific one member.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It's every member's duty to respect other's opinion.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Second, taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone's opinion that is against you.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even if you are not working in a group, you still need to take others' criticism.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Criticism definitely hurts because it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Those who don't even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In other words, if you can't take any criticism, not only will you fail in cooperating with other people, but also get defeated in personal works.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As one Chinese idiom goes: "The good medicine tastes bitter“.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, some people might ask: what if the criticism proves to be wrong?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What if that I was at first right but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me to the wrong direction?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Doesn't insistence also a good character?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my point of view, even if you are right, criticism is still helpful because in this case it not only is a fixer, but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Taking criticism doesn't necessary mean that you have to take it all.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You should have your own judgments too!</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And it's kind of art to make the best use of criticism.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It's <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">just</MPQAPOL> like a <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">picky</MPQAPOL> mirror through which we can see the <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">bad</MPQAPOL> side of us and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">thus</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">try</MPQAPOL> to become more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">beautiful</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">confident</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
