<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Arts and public services are both important to the community and should be invested properly

There has been wide opinion that Government should invest more money on public services rather than arts such as music and theatre.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, in my perspective, both public services and arts worth investment.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Investing in hospitals helps improve people's health, also, in schools assists with raising our children's education level.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately, our standard of living would deteriorate.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Arts include many forms and music as well as cinema are the most typical.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment, for instance K-pop and Hollywood, and these industries can not <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">survive</MPQAPOL> without goverment's financial assistance.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The long and the short of it, both arts and public services are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">important</MPQAPOL> to the community and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be invested <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">properly</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
