Although many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face, personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, communicating by e-mail is easy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, you can write an e-mail at any time of the day.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As for me, I work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thirdly, when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And finally, there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To sum up, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">like</MPQAPOL> to say that for me both options of communicating are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">possible</MPQAPOL>, but if this is an <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">important</MPQAPOL> and not <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">urgent</MPQAPOL> question I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">prefer</MPQAPOL> to answer it by means of internet or voice mail.</MPQASENT>
