<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Children from poorer families are more successful in the future life.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">According to some people, child who is brought up in less well-off family is more quick-witted and can tackle with an adult life problems better than who is from affluent ones.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, I completely disagree with this position.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To begin with, children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as: crime, thievery and thuggery.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, these people will not have an access to a good education.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a result, they can be proselytized into bad isms.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people, because the person with better education has a wider outlook, which will allow no brainwash.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this sense, people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nevertheless, people who are born in well-off families have access to good education, which will have a positive impact on their later life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Secondly, children from rich families have better skills on how to use money, because they use it a lot of times.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Finally, wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines, which will be very beneficial for the health of a child.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instance, many good medicines cost vast amounts of money, which cannot be afforded by poorer families.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">disagree</MPQAPOL> with the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">opinion</MPQAPOL> that children who are brought up in less well-of families are, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">likely</MPQAPOL>, more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">successful</MPQAPOL> in the future life due to aforementioned <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
