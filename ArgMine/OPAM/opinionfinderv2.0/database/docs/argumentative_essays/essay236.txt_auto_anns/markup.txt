<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Should professors doing more research or educating students more?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing, teaching, we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with, doing research.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him/herself forward all the time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And then he or she can do better in teaching works.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instance, the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr. Yang who keeps in researching and reading.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA, the excellent teacher.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As for students, we can get what we want to know from textbooks, webs or teachers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If a professor doesn't get any researching works, he cannot give us the opportunity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In addition, a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That is good for both of the professor and students.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally, all professors in the university are fortune of the society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They are the leaders almost in every fields of science, arts, culture and so on.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Without their research, there will be no new technologies come out quickly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Without their research, there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Without their research, there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And it's <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">worth</MPQAPOL> to spend more time on it than on teaching.</MPQASENT>
