<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lessons with teachers versus others sources

Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They all enrich our daily lives.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In this case, students learn things easily.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, they contend that good television programs do teach students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Personally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Just</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">imagine</MPQAPOL>: if a student can't <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">even</MPQAPOL> make out whether the source is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasonable</MPQAPOL> or not, then how can he get the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">right</MPQAPOL> information to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">help</MPQAPOL> him to learn?</MPQASENT>
