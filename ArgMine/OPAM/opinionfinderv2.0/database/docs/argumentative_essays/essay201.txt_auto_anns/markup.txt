<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Spending money on supporting art or protecting environment

If I had the opportunity to help a company make a decision on spending money either on supporting the arts or helping the environment, I would choose the latter without hesitation for the reasons below.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First, conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association, we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed, which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What's more, rising sea levels, caused by global warming, have reached a level that is threatening human's life in many countries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars, nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change, causing flooding, drought, and an increasing amount of damaging storms.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In short, the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn't take harsh measures now, we never will.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nowadays, an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation; therefore, sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment, then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally, conservation leads us to a higher standard of living.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I confess that art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings, but, with exhaust fumes and acid rain, we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Biodiversity and a more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">beautiful</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">nature</MPQAPOL> are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To sum up, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">although</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">supporting</MPQAPOL> art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">interest</MPQAPOL>, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">still</MPQAPOL> hold the environment <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">protection</MPQAPOL> for long-term <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">interest</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
