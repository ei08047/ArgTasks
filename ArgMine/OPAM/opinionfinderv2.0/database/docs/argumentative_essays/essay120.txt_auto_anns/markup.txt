<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, as the society grows, human rights become more highly respected, "murdering" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all, it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, they are humans and their lives need to be valued.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition, execution does not resolve the consequences of crime, not to mention it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Secondly, capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Juries are also humans, they may lack of discretion.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus, many people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">although</MPQAPOL> capital punishment presents an <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">extreme</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">warning</MPQAPOL> to the community, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">firmly</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">object</MPQAPOL> to it because it is <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">absurd</MPQAPOL> and inhumane.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Furthermore</MPQAPOL>, it can be replaced by a life sentence.</MPQASENT>
