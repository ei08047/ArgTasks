<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Follow the New Customs of the New Country or Not?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When people move to another country, most likely, they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture, while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As for me, I would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On one hand, it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a result, people understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although being much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Their houses and private cars were buried by local people, because the locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> not have been <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">regards</MPQAPOL> as a group of Chinese and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">discrimination</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">might</MPQAPOL> have been <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">alleviated</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All in all, the immigrants <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> follow the customs in the new country, which can <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">help</MPQAPOL> them <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">survive</MPQAPOL> from the culture <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">shock</MPQAPOL> sooner, and assimilate to a new culture.</MPQASENT>
