<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Use of CCTV cameras

Today, close circuit television (CCTV) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They are used in schools, businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer, especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nevertheless, some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even so, I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To illustrate this further, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not only that, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus, it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At times, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hence, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the event of an argument, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In short, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Looking from another perspective, the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ergo, opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To conclude, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Admittedly</MPQAPOL>, privacies are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">lost</MPQAPOL> with the use of these cameras.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nonetheless, safety <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be put first in order to be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">safe</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
