Education is undeniably an economic necessity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In most countries, it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In highly industrialized countries, undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In a developing country, not many can afford to send their children to school.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen, can hardly eat three meals a day, let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As a result, these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors, lawyers or engineers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Basic education teaches one child to read and write.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In the same way, a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Collectively, the benefits of education can make a man, a society and a developed country.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The more people in the country become educated, the <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">better</MPQAPOL> chance it can develop.</MPQASENT>
