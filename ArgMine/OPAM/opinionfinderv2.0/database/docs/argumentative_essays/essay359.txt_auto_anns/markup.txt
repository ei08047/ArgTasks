<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">International tourism leads to both - tension and understanding

I agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture, because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Firstly, some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, Indians don't eat beef since they worship cows.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Thus</MPQAPOL>, if tourists <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">want</MPQAPOL> to <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">respect</MPQAPOL> the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">tradition</MPQAPOL>, they will not order any beef in the local restaurant.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, in order to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">avoid</MPQAPOL> the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">conflicts</MPQAPOL> between foreigners and locals, people are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">trying</MPQAPOL> to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">understand</MPQAPOL> different culture and find solutions.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For instance, tourists are given the brochures about the local <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">traditions</MPQAPOL> and customs before they visit the place.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Furthermore</MPQAPOL>, the tour guide are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">willing</MPQAPOL> to <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">help</MPQAPOL> tourists to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">understand</MPQAPOL> the culture from other countries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Thus</MPQAPOL>, the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">possibility</MPQAPOL> of the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">conflicts</MPQAPOL> is reduced because the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">understanding</MPQAPOL> between both parties.</MPQASENT>
