<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Funding artists

Nowadays, in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country, every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists, but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In fact, some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue, thus, the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition, sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Another reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Indeed, not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Hence, this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">To sum up, art is a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">very</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">valuable</MPQAPOL> object for every country and the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">talent</MPQAPOL> in this area cannot be discovered everywhere, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">so</MPQAPOL> I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">think</MPQAPOL> governments <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">help</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">encourage</MPQAPOL> artists to continue their work.</MPQASENT>
