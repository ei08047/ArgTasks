<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their olde

It might seem that teenaged children particularly in age of 15 - 18 are fully grown, so they do not need any help for making important decisions.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">However, in my opinion, teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I will discuss my view in two main areas.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the first place, there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children, therefore they are the best advisor for their children.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life, so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Also, they can save value things in their life such as time and money, and enjoy they life with the best way.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers, because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They cheat young ages because they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To sum up, it makes no <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">difference</MPQAPOL>, people from young ages to old ages are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">free</MPQAPOL> to make a decision, nonetheless sometimes to prevent some <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">problems</MPQAPOL> coming up for young individuals , it is a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">good</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">idea</MPQAPOL> to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advice</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
