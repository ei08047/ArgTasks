<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life

Nowadays, the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before, parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them, just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that, for example, asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In my views, I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First of all, when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus, it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Take me as an example, when I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Unfortunately, I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, by taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instance, if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To compare with the school life, they might suffer only a small punishment at school.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Under the circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">help</MPQAPOL> their children to adapt adult life, parents <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> let them experience it as <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">much</MPQAPOL> as they can.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Due to the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL> given <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">above</MPQAPOL>, to <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">encourage</MPQAPOL> children taking a part-time job is a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">good</MPQAPOL> choice for them to get prepared for adult life.</MPQASENT>
