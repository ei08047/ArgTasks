<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Government and education

Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people; however, for the more higher education like university, the students or their parents should pay for the fees.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the other hand, I don't think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students' primary and secondary education.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition to that, the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore, this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">completely</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">agree</MPQAPOL> that government <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">just</MPQAPOL> depend on the government to do all their <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">responsibilities</MPQAPOL> for them.</MPQASENT>
