Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This factor is still affecting thinking of many people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, the current job market affects the decision of universities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The job selection criteria are pre decided.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They prefer male staff for night shifts.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To conclude, I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Our youth has become very confident towards his career.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Female candidates also do not <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">care</MPQAPOL> about any <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">restriction</MPQAPOL> posed by the society and the employer.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">So</MPQAPOL> we <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">must</MPQAPOL> give them <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">opportunity</MPQAPOL> to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">achieve</MPQAPOL> their goal.</MPQASENT>
