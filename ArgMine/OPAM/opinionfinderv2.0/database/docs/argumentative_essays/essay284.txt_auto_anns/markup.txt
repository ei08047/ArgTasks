<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Should good people are rewarded and bad people are punished in movies or dramas?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">When we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While there are also some people who do not like this.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Personally, I prefer to see good people get rewarded.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, if the good people always get an happy ending, I don’t think it’s proper.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then we will feel less interested in them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For example, Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But now many people, including me, have been tired with it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They will be misleading by those movies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And they may act like good people in order to get reward.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In fact, those good endings sometimes are helpful.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people may be encouraged to do good things.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But like I said, this kind of behavior won’t last long, because someday they will realize the truth.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And if they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Based on my <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">arguments</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">above</MPQAPOL>, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">think</MPQAPOL> movies and TV programs <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> present different stories in which <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">good</MPQAPOL> people get reward or get nothing.</MPQASENT>
