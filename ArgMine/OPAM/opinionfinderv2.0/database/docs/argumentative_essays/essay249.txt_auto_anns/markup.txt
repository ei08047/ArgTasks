<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In 19th century, television is one of an significant inventions and has become a indispensible appliance in every house.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For its accessible and containing fancy programs, television attracts audiences from a wide range of age and background.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Children, who are addicted to TV, causes broad argument about whether they should be limited in watching television in amount of time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As far as I am concerned, I agree with that children should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all, children generally have weak self-control, and thus they lose their time easily.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I, in my childhood, was just a typical case.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Whenever I back to home from school, the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I could watch TV for hours, but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing, but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I, therefore, did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, sometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Children are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad, therefore they are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Recently, more and more children smoke because they imitate actors' behaviors on TV or movies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What's even worse, according to some statistics, there are more and more children have violent tendency, and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is obvious that there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">How can anyone expect children could do well at school if they have those abnormal behaviors?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Admittedly, in concerning the social relationship with peers, some may support that children should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I agree with this viewpoint to some extent.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, it doesn't mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching.</MPQASENT>
