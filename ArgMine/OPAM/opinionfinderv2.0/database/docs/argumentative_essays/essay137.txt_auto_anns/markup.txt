<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Popular events are essential
  
A world sportive competition event is watched by almost every country around the world and provide social stimulus and people gathering.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems, others think that they are just entertainment to distract people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I believe that they are important somehow, but not essential.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a matter of fact, world sport events provide positive waves for number of people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These emotions are shared locally in our village or city, nationally in our own country but even internationally too.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus, if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal, the reality is different.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In other words, this is the "calm before the storm".</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After the Olympics games are finished, everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To picture it, recently, Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries, but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn't listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Finally, an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people, let them dream, being proud of their nationality and forget problems, but just for a while.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs.</MPQASENT>
