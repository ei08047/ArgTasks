<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Alternative forms of transport to alleviate traffic congestion

Recently, a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation, while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What is worse, traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus, the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In order to solve these problems, alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With regard to the former, alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, it is a better form to protect environment than automobile.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As for the latter point, the introduction of international laws can be also effective.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For instance, there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus, these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In summary, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">even</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">though</MPQAPOL> some people <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">claim</MPQAPOL> the convenience of automobile, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">necessary</MPQAPOL> due to the environmental <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">protection</MPQAPOL> and the alleviation of traffic <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">congestion</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
