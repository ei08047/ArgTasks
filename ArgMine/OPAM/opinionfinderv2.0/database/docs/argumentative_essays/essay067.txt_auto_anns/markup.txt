<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Creative Artists

Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Let's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By way of conclusion, I do not root for the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">idea</MPQAPOL> that <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">restrictions</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be put on artists work; on the contrary, they <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">encouraged</MPQAPOL> to express their <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">innovative</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">ideas</MPQAPOL> – this world <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">needs</MPQAPOL> them to make itself colourful.</MPQASENT>
