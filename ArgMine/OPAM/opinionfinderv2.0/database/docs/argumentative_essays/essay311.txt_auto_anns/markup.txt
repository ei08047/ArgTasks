<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is not necessary for university students to attend classes

Though out the last decade, the load of the university students has been constantly increasing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">However, from my perspective, students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The reasons to be illustrated are follows.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, I love Physics.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But I don't like electronics, because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Luckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And the students will have nothing to do in the campus.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then he or she will play online games days and nights.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The academic achievement will decline.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the end, this student will become a loser in the world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Admittedly, the university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All in all, the university <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">allow</MPQAPOL> the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated.</MPQASENT>
