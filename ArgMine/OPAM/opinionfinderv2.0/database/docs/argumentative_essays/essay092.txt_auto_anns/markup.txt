<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">should one follow fashion trends rather than a personal style?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With increasing availability to the Internet, people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world, such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In contrast, if they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a result, they might fall behind shortly.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore, people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Without following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Despite this, it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Consequently, the world would look monotonous.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With those <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">arguments</MPQAPOL> in mind, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> conclude that people <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL>, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">especially</MPQAPOL> for ones lacking <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">basic</MPQAPOL> aesthetic <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">knowledge</MPQAPOL>, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">care</MPQAPOL> more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">On the other hand, <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">creative</MPQAPOL> design <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">talents</MPQAPOL> can <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">value</MPQAPOL> their own dressing <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">ideas</MPQAPOL>, developing their own fashion styles as they <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">like</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
