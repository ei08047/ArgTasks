<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Television versus Friends and family

We all know that television provides us many benefits; it helps people relax, helps keep up with news, helps broad our mind.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, with the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a consequence, children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this way, communication between family members is visibly destroyed.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Last but not least, watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">is this one of the reason cause division in society?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, though television has some good sides, it has destroyed communication among friends and family.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">need</MPQAPOL> to quickly find the way to address this <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">problem</MPQAPOL> as soon as <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">possible</MPQAPOL> and the first <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">concern</MPQAPOL> is to reducing <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">violent</MPQAPOL> behaviors that children learn from television.</MPQASENT>
