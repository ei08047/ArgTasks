<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Students should be required to take regular standardized tests

The issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example some students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Additionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, standardized tests offer them such chance.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally, I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who donâ€™t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Ultimately</MPQAPOL> I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">feel</MPQAPOL> that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">right</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I belive this, due to the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">fact</MPQAPOL> that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">appropriate</MPQAPOL> education to their students.</MPQASENT>
