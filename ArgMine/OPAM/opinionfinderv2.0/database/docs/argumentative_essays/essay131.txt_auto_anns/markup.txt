The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services, I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First of all, there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Admittedly, no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health, education, transportation and communication.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, these could only help individuals with their physical requirements.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts.</MPQASENT>
