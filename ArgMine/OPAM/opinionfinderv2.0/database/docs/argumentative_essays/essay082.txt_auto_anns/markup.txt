<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.</MPQASENT>
