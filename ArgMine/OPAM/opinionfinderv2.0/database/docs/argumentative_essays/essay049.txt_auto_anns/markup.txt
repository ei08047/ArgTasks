<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Do modern communication technologies benefit all people

Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To begin with, mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Nevertheless, opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By way of conclusion, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">believe</MPQAPOL> that <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">modern</MPQAPOL> communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases; <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">however</MPQAPOL>, the have-nots cannot be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">ignored</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">simply</MPQAPOL> because they <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">could</MPQAPOL>n't <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">afford</MPQAPOL> it.</MPQASENT>
