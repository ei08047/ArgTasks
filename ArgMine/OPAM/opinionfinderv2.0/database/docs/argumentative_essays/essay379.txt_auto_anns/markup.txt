Along with the increasing physical demands of human life, salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the following paragraphs, some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On one hand, i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human' basic needs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">More specifically, people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family's living needs such as food , clothes, accommodation, education, medication.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries, for example, will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is because they are doing what they love, their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the other hand, i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working, we are likely to achieve success easily in that field.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There are plenty of people, who are now really successful, have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers, dancers and painters.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Besides, important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness, satisfaction of jobs, personal relationships, professional skills, working environment, managers and colleagues should not be underestimated.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally, some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies.</MPQASENT>
