Achieving success is everybody's goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances, while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Which one is the promising way to succeed?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, I believe that once you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First, being positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Take myself for example, when I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second, being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In other words, once you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Take the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, being different and unique is the better way to achieve success.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It not only <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">shows</MPQAPOL> your <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">competence</MPQAPOL> but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">success</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
