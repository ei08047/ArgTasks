<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The maintenance of traditional skills and ways of life?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions, and there is no need to maintain them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, from my point of view, what can be expected, is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is undeniable that the country's culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instance, in Vietnam, many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities, are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor's early life through books and images, which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In tradition, a person should look back at the past, mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle, to progress.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Understanding why, and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Also, study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To sumarize, there <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> never be any replacement for <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">traditional</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">skills</MPQAPOL> or ways of life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They are the ones that teach, and will teach us to be self-esteem and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">experienced</MPQAPOL>, which <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">means</MPQAPOL> their preservation throughout history <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">deserve</MPQAPOL> our attention.</MPQASENT>
