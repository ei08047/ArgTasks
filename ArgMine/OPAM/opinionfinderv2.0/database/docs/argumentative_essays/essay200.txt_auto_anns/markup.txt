Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet, for human are polluting the Earth's environment, exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">People are corrupting their ecosphere.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a "new" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Besides, people are draining the Earth's natural resources.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">These resources such as oil, coal are vital for human activity, therefore nowadays, the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after, the Earth's natural resources are totally exhausted.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At that time, human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Also, people are endangering other species' live.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Through million years of hunting, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">especially</MPQAPOL> in recent centuries with the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">innovation</MPQAPOL> of rifle and dynamite, people have <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">killed</MPQAPOL> many animals and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">even</MPQAPOL> have made some kinds of them become extinct.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Moreover</MPQAPOL>, people, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">suffering</MPQAPOL> from the population <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">pressure</MPQAPOL>, are expanding their living area; <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">consequently</MPQAPOL>, the living area of other species narrowed.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction.</MPQASENT>
