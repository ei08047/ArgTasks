<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Zoos should be built to protect rural animals

Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">By way of conclusion, it is my <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">belief</MPQAPOL> that <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">wild</MPQAPOL> animals <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be set <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">free</MPQAPOL> from zoos not only because they have the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">right</MPQAPOL> to <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">enjoy</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">freedom</MPQAPOL> but they also escape from <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">isolation</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">depression</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
