<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren't good at the things.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">That may help you expand experiences, look for your personalities and find your new talents.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This ideal, however, doesn't necessarily be accomplished.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If not, you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So, I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at.</MPQASENT>
