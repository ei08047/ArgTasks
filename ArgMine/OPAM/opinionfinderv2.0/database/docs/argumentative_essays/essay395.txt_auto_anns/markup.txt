Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Firstly, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Obviously, this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation; therefore, the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition, the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nevertheless, we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the whole, I do <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">believe</MPQAPOL> that taxes paying for state schools are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">necessary</MPQAPOL> to be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">compulsory</MPQAPOL> for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in.</MPQASENT>
