<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">School memories

Everyone has happy moments during their life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In my opinion, childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First, in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They do not have to worry about bills, jobs, how would their life be in the future.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They just worry about two things: to have fun, learn and be happy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A child's daily life is school, playing and sleeping.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, I did not have to worry about costs and other things, I just had fun and learned.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Also, people are most creative when they were children, children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second, childhood is the period where people go to school and learn.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, school memories are one of the best memories in a person's life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There you learn, to find your first love, to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, my father's best moments in his life are in his school years.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In other words, childhood is, indeed, the most happiest moments in a person's life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There is only one life and one childhood and people <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> live their childhood thoroughly.</MPQASENT>
