<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Should teachers be paid according to how much their students learn?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Everyone is different.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Although students are in the same process of education system, learning abilities in each students are not equal.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some students are fast learner, but some students are not.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus, paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate, and it is not fair for teacher.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So that, I disagree with this notion.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To begin with, in schools, main task of teacher to give knowledge to students, and this role have to finish in time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">there are certain period of time for teachers to teach.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In these short time, it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If teachers pay attention to specific students, their work might not finish on time, and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second, learning abilities in each students is different.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, testing result are different.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This problems depend on how hard study they do.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is not teachers fault.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus, teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lastly, there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That is problem in quality of education.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This problem should not be happened.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, I totally <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">disagree</MPQAPOL> with this statement that teachers <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be paid by how <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">much</MPQAPOL> their students learn because teacher <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">could</MPQAPOL> not pay attention to each students in class.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Besides</MPQAPOL>, learning <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">abilities</MPQAPOL> of student are different.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Moreover</MPQAPOL>, there are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">problems</MPQAPOL> if paying teacher by grade students get.</MPQASENT>
