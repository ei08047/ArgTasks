<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Universities should give money to sport activities or libraries

Libraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First, I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because, after internet, library plays an important role in research.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Although sport is important, it does not have the same priority of library has.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition only small part of students attend sport activities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Second, usually libraries do not have income.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Most libraries are free not for students also for public.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hence, universities support is vital for libraries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Also, they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To conclude, there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses, but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Last but not least, investing in libraries has a long-time result.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Besides, in the far future, they become more valuable.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the other side, most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">spite</MPQAPOL> of the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">importance</MPQAPOL> of sports activities, libraries are more <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">important</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They are <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">critical</MPQAPOL> part of universities and a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">good</MPQAPOL> university has to have a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">modern</MPQAPOL> library.</MPQASENT>
