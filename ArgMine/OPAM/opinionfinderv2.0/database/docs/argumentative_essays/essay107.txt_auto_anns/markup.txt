<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To add to it, excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lastly, either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To conclude, Earth is our home and it should be protected.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Creative</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">ideas</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">encouraged</MPQAPOL> to leave minimum environmental footprints without <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">compromising</MPQAPOL> quality of life.</MPQASENT>
