<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It's obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From my point of view, I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the first place, children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Imagine an actor who is a child’s favorite is doing violent roles.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus, unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Meanwhile, human beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For instance, dying is always a disappointing happening.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, killing is worse.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, if these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally, beside all above mentioned items, the study of youngsters shall always been controlled.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, a child watches a frightening movie.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, he has to study for the exam.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In this condition, because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it, it is obvious that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hence, the study of a youngster would affected terribly.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">certainly</MPQAPOL> can say that growing of violence in films have <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">definitely</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">negative</MPQAPOL> effects on youngsters <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">mostly</MPQAPOL> on their study, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">emotions</MPQAPOL> and behaviors.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Therefore</MPQAPOL>, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">think</MPQAPOL> this matter <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be controlled by parents or somehow by directors.</MPQASENT>
