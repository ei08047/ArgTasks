<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Young adults preference on how long they should live with their parents before moving out

As young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But, the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Living on your own is a huge financial commitment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job, so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So, I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Living together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While some critics may argue that, young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a nutshell, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">believe</MPQAPOL> that young adults <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> only <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">consider</MPQAPOL> living on their own only after they are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">sure</MPQAPOL> they <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">could</MPQAPOL> sustain on their own.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">unwise</MPQAPOL> to trade the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">opportunity</MPQAPOL> of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Thus</MPQAPOL>, to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life, to make financial life a less <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">struggle</MPQAPOL> and to prevent oneself digress from their <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">destined</MPQAPOL> path, it is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">important</MPQAPOL> for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time.</MPQASENT>
