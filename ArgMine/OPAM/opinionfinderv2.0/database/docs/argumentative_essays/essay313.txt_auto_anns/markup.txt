<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Our useful friends

Pets have always been essential in our society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds, tortoises and fishes as well.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people think that pets should be treated like family members.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, others argue that they are just animals and aren't able to think like us.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The issue is controversial but in my opinion, pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First, pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Similarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We can talk to them because they listen to us, more than some people will ever do.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To illustrate this point, I can write about my own experience.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since I was all alone at home for a long time, my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Clearly, although pets aren't able to speak with us, we can nonetheless count on them.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, pets are useful for a variety of things.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition, pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">To sum up, I am strongly <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">convinced</MPQAPOL> that pets <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">deserve</MPQAPOL> to be treated like family members because of all the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL> mentioned <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">above</MPQAPOL>, namely they are our <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">friends</MPQAPOL> and they can be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">useful</MPQAPOL> in many situations.</MPQASENT>
