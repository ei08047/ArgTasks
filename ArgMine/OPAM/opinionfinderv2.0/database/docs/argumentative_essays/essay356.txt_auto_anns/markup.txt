<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Problems and benefits of international tourism

Along with the advancement of long-distance transportation, international tourism has boomed in the last few decades.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I disagree with this view.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In order to meet the needs of tourists, local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may result in the destruction of natural habitats.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Tourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Based on these grounds, it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With adequate local facilities and services available, they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition, both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before, and they can be more open-minded to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">eliminate</MPQAPOL> preconceptions and deepen mutual <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">understanding</MPQAPOL> among nations.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">prosperity</MPQAPOL> of tourism can provide <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">benefits</MPQAPOL> for people on a global scale.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Although</MPQAPOL> there are some <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">inevitable</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">problems</MPQAPOL>, they are outweighed by <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advantages</MPQAPOL> and can be tackled if <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">proper</MPQAPOL> measures are taken.</MPQASENT>
