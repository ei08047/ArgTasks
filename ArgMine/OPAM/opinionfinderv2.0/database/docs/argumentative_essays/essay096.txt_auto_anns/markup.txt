<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Jury must have access to criminals' past records

It is a well known fact that a jury involved in a case has no information regarding the criminal's past illegal acts under the British and Australian laws.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are few of those who are concerned think the current practice should be altered and that the juries should at least know something about the criminals before coming to a conclusion.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I, for one, agree to this resolution whole-heartedly as it poses advantages to various parties as I shall discuss below.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First and foremost, I believe that it would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is because, knowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For instance, take a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then, punishment can be given in accordance to the condition.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Apart from that, a fair trial can be achieved.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As all of us know, juries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus, exposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By doing so, the juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not only that, the convicted will also receive a fair action.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is undeniable that when the background of the convicted is 'dug' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people, his privacy is being jeopardized.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If finally he is proven innocent, he may feel embarrassed to face the public.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, I am sure that the crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To conclude, I definitely feel that the current way of the juries judging the case should be transformed and they should know the facts about the criminals they are dealing with.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is of paramount importance so that they will be able to give a better and reliable as well as a fair judgment to the convicted.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Beneficial changes will <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">certainly</MPQAPOL> take place if changes are made because for a change to happen, changes have to be done.</MPQASENT>
