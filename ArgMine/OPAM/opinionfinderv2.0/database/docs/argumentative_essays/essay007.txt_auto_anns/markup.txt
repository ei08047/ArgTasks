<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Will newspapers become a thing of the past?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The internet has been more and more popular for recent years, providing people with a huge source of information.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a result of this, print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some people, however, still believe that they can exist for long time; others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Another point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Last, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">simply</MPQAPOL> the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At this <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">point</MPQAPOL>, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, it <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">might</MPQAPOL> be <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">unpleasant</MPQAPOL> for some <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">advocating</MPQAPOL> newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">However</MPQAPOL>, this, if occurring, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be seen as a result of the ever-increasing <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">innovations</MPQAPOL> in media technology and in our <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">modern</MPQAPOL> life as a whole.</MPQASENT>
