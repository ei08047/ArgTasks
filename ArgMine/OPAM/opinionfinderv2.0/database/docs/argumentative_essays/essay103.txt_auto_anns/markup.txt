<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jury must have access to criminals' past records

Courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant, except those of the UK and Australia.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions, which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant's personality.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore, past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes, such as kidnapping or a murder.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nevertheless, in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience, the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For instance, a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Innocent suspects, eventually, can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant's history to the jury, with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Thus</MPQAPOL>, I strongly <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">support</MPQAPOL> the current laws of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Great</MPQAPOL> Britain and Australia, and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions.</MPQASENT>
