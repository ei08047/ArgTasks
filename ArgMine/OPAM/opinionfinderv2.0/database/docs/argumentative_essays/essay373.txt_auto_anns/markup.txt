"Capital punishment or the death penalty is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime."</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In recently years, many countries have polished the law of the death penalty.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the whole world, 51% countries have polished death penalty; even, it is at 98% in Europe.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Personally, I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Firstly, capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Crimes kill someone which is illegal; nevertheless, the government use law to punish them, which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time; also, it is regarded as the "legalized revenge" to victims' family.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hence, death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, nobody has the right to take another human life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No one has the right to take the life of a human; even if he committed murder.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If you kill a criminal, you become a criminal.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem, it is neither unethical nor immoral.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In short, crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Finally, with some of serious criminals, capital punishment is an easy way out.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins, it is so easy for them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">They do not undergo any pain or misery.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Why do not we have other wisely punishments?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As we can see some industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, reclamation, etc, needs many labors.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country- it is better.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">To conclude, capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge, it is an easy way for serious crimes, and nobody has rights to take others life; thus, it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The world <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">consider</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">clearly</MPQAPOL> about polishing the law of the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">dead</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">penalty</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
