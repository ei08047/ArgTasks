<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Should high school make music lessons compulsory

Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">An integration of music into learning process bound to be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">successful</MPQAPOL> when it is not <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">compulsory</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
