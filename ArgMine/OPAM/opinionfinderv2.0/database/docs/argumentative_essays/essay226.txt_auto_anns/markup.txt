<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First of all, the predecessors' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As everyone's life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare, we all should learn about other's mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Each mistake, from the smallest to the bigger one, is a treasure of experience, which, if we can make full use of, will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times.</MPQASENT>
