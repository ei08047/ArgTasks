<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Financial support for sports and social activities

There are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges, I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students' lives.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the following, I will state my reason for this choice.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First, besides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In my viewpoint, our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a case in point, last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well!</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a result, sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second, besides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a practical epitome, students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So, social activities have same rights to receive monetary support.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">If we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In my <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">perspective</MPQAPOL>, more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">friends</MPQAPOL> and new experience <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">inspire</MPQAPOL> the <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">feeling</MPQAPOL> of <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">happiness</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">excitement</MPQAPOL> in me.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All in all, I am in the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">conviction</MPQAPOL> that sports and social activities <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> obtain analogous <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">concern</MPQAPOL> and money in the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">view</MPQAPOL> of above-mentioned <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They bring a lot of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advantages</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">benefits</MPQAPOL> for students and also <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">affect</MPQAPOL> their future in a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">positive</MPQAPOL> way.</MPQASENT>
