<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Do guns can really increase the level of violence?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Personally, I tend to disagree with this statement, while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the one hand, I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">An obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Obviously, police officers can force a criminal to surrender, because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a result, some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Secondly, cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, it <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">seems</MPQAPOL> to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">However</MPQAPOL>, some cases occupy a crucial <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reason</MPQAPOL> to do a criminality in society <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">such</MPQAPOL> unemployment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In my <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">view</MPQAPOL>, the main focus is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">decreasing</MPQAPOL> a level of unemployment to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">avoid</MPQAPOL> a criminal act.</MPQASENT>
