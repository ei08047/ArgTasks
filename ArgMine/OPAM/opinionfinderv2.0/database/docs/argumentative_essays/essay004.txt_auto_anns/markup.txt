<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">International tourism is now more common than ever before

The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Secondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As the Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat’s anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For this reason, many marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus, it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To conclude, I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">precious</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">values</MPQAPOL>, they will be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">destroyed</MPQAPOL> in the near future.</MPQASENT>
