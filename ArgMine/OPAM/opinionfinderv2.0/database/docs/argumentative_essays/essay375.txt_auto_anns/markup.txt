<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Languages' extinction, discuss both views

It is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken, every language should be protected from being disappeared.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Firstly, we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages, it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese, so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers, facilities and appropriate materials.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Secondly, it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication, trade, cooperation as well as transaction, it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Despite of the above arguments, i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition, forming a language must be undergone thousands of years; thus, it deserves to be respected and preserved.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Last but not least, language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity's preservation.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">although</MPQAPOL> letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">seems</MPQAPOL> to be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">very</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">beneficial</MPQAPOL>, it will <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">definitely</MPQAPOL> impact <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">seriously</MPQAPOL> on many other aspects <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">especially</MPQAPOL> in the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">loss</MPQAPOL> of our cultural heritages.</MPQASENT>
