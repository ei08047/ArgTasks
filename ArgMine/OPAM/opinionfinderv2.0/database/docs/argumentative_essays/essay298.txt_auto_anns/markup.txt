<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Part time job for teenage students

When we talk about student, we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In some country, teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In my view, it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he/she is still a student and this is for two reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Students can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As i had to spend some of my time in my job, therefore, i had to manage my time efficiently.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, I learn money management.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From this i learned, how to manage money correctly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For instance, when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I taught math to two kids of my neighbor.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As you can see, part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In sum, I am sure; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They will argue, it can destruct students from their study.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result; therefore, i believe part time job will be good for students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Every Student <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> do part time job beside their study if they <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">want</MPQAPOL> to prepare more efficiently for their future.</MPQASENT>
