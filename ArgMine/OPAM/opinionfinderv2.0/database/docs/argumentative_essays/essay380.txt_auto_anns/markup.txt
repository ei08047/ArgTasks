<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Increased taxation on petrol and diesel fuel to discourage private cars?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, cars themselves, especially private ones, have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Additionally, for those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To be precise, the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Consequently, people have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Suppose</MPQAPOL> that the those countries <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">cut</MPQAPOL> down on its oil <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">support</MPQAPOL>, other nations will have to pay more as <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">well</MPQAPOL> as release <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">beneficial</MPQAPOL> policies for them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">America, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">crisis</MPQAPOL> only due to the influx of oil.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To summarize, higher fuel and petrol cost has its own <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">pros</MPQAPOL> and cons.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">However</MPQAPOL>, it disadvantages may outweigh its <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advantages</MPQAPOL> with <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">regard</MPQAPOL> to economic and politic issues, making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars.</MPQASENT>
