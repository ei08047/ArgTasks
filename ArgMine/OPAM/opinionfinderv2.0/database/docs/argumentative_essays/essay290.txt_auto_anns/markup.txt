<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people prefer to work for a large company

Companies vary from small to large ones based on the context, success and needs of their work.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Small companies usually have a local job in the area, while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First, to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing, managing and selling their products in different countries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country, they would need more employees in that country to work there.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In other words, Large company equals more job opportunity.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second, I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The fact that a company is a large one, this means that it's having a considerable success.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In other words, this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instance, common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won't give the same salary as a small local company.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Third, I love travelling around the world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">large companies have an international reputation, as they organize international conferences, meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, i can <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">certainly</MPQAPOL> state that I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">rather</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">prefer</MPQAPOL> working in a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">large</MPQAPOL> company than in a small one.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I have different <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL> to hold that, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">such</MPQAPOL> as having a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">better</MPQAPOL> chance to find work, having a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">better</MPQAPOL> salary and having the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">opportunity</MPQAPOL> to travel around the world to attend international conferences.</MPQASENT>
