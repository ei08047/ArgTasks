<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Working at home vs Working in a company

Due to the convenience of current technology, people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">People are no longer restricted in the office.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it's better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company's office.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First of all, while working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Think about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he/she can assemble his/her colleges right away and discuss.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For another example, if oneâ€™s computer or Internet has any breakdown, he/she can call the MIS staff to fix.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second, working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, people are easily distracted while working at home.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition, while people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It not only has the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advantage</MPQAPOL> of working with colleges but also it provides a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">real</MPQAPOL> working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home.</MPQASENT>
