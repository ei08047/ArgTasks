<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Early retirement for 55+ employees to help younger people

Nowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young, others claim that this is not the case.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Admittedly, encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Firstly, fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Compared with aged staffs, younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From personal level, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it, disregard the age and physical capacity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From social perspective, massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">even</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">though</MPQAPOL> the introduction of the early retirement has some <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">benefits</MPQAPOL>, it is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">convincing</MPQAPOL> that it <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> generate a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">sense</MPQAPOL> of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">discrimination</MPQAPOL> among different age groups and increase the government financial <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">pressure</MPQAPOL> accordingly.</MPQASENT>
