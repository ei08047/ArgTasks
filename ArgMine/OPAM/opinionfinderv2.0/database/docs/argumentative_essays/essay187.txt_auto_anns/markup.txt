<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Where to learn a new language?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country, I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Person 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In other words, he is not jumping into the foreign country.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Besides, all the learners are probably from the same country, so all these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He also has access to the most up-to-date language.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus he can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'A', does not have access to.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the whole, if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel, I would definitely make the second choice.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language, you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a word, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">although</MPQAPOL> each of these methods have their <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">pros</MPQAPOL> and cons, I am <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">pretty</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">sure</MPQAPOL> that <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advantages</MPQAPOL> of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advantages</MPQAPOL> of the other way of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">learning</MPQAPOL> of a new language.</MPQASENT>
