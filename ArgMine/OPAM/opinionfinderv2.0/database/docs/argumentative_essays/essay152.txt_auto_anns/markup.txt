<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Do you believe that elderly people used to live in a better world?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Changes are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion though, social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Today, even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To be specific, scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In general, the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends, I think they are wrong, since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">light</MPQAPOL> of the above-mentioned <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">facts</MPQAPOL>, one can <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">easily</MPQAPOL> conclude that in the current world living standards <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">stand</MPQAPOL> in a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">much</MPQAPOL> higher level and people are in <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">better</MPQAPOL> conditions socially and physically.</MPQASENT>
