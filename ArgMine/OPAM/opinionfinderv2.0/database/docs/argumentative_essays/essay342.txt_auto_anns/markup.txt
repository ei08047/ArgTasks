In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend, which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them, and also be able to teach them teamwork skill.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative, both the values have its arguments.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers, and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents, to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently, but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Being competitive leads them to success, but could also restrict them in many ways.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children, no matter in school activities or in communities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others, which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After all, in society, there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For example, famous singers or movie stars, despite of their talent to make them successful, there are always a team to manage works or deal with things.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In my <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">point</MPQAPOL> of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">view</MPQAPOL>, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">though</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">competitive</MPQAPOL> child <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> have more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">motivation</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">perspective</MPQAPOL> that leads them to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">success</MPQAPOL>, but it <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> not <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">help</MPQAPOL> them <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">much</MPQAPOL> once they enter to society or company which required more about <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">skill</MPQAPOL> of team work.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To sum up, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> say that schools and adults <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> put a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">sense</MPQAPOL> of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">cooperation</MPQAPOL> in children to make them becoming a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">useful</MPQAPOL> adult whether in society or community.</MPQASENT>
