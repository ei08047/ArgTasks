<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Challenges are different from generation to generation

While debating about generation issues, people always have different opinions.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some people believe that little things changed through generation, while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First, under globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the past, focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, as those industries expand and become internationalized, people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, now there are more chances to do business with people around the world, so besides one's own profession, language ability is essential as well.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For another example, financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century, thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second, this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In contrast, young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation, whether in career or in self-identification.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">hard</MPQAPOL> to judge which generation's <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">problems</MPQAPOL> are more <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">difficult</MPQAPOL> but it is no <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">doubt</MPQAPOL> that until the next generation, there will be whole new <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">challenges</MPQAPOL> waiting for the next youngsters.</MPQASENT>
