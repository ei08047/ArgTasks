<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Teachers lesson vs other sources
 
The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations, and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources, I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students' acquisition of knowledge.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields, and as the students answer these questions, the facts has been learned and reinforced.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams, as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Moreover</MPQAPOL>, when students have some academic <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">problems</MPQAPOL>, they can post those to some websites and receive <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">correct</MPQAPOL> answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Besides</MPQAPOL>, in the past, conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves, now all can be done at a click of a button.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Thus</MPQAPOL>, technologies are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">vital</MPQAPOL> in students' <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">learning</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">well</MPQAPOL> as formal educators.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At schools, students' development has been orchestrated stage by stage, step by step by <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">experienced</MPQAPOL> teachers, and their acquisition of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">knowledge</MPQAPOL> is guided and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">backed</MPQAPOL> up in a <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">systematic</MPQAPOL> way.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Therefore</MPQAPOL>, formal education approaches are also <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">indispensable</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To put it all in a nutshell, I pen out saying that alternative sources information and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">traditional</MPQAPOL> education systems are equally <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">important</MPQAPOL> in children's development.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">So</MPQAPOL> students <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> learn both from their teachers as <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">well</MPQAPOL> as <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">modern</MPQAPOL> technology to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">gain</MPQAPOL> the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">best</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">learning</MPQAPOL> outcome.</MPQASENT>
