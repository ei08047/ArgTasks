<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Study at home by using technology/study or traditional school

I don't think that technology can replace teachers and classroom.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Here are my reasons.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Studying at home by using technology is convenient.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In addition, you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You can study any time you want.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, if you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First, attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Especially when you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Unfortunately, it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Second, studying at home is very different from traditional learning.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Unlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We can learn a lot from programs at home; however, our computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">above</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL>, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">agree</MPQAPOL> that distance education can't replace <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">traditional</MPQAPOL> school.</MPQASENT>
