<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life

Learning is a thing that we do in all of our lives.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Getting the best lessons, besides our abilities to self-study, depends on our teachers a lot.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As we were born, parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile, how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, when we grow bigger, they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages, but after school we learn from our parents.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I think when we leave school, maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life, but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thirdly, I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, even when we grow older, get married and then have our own families with spouses and children, parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instance, my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life, he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To conclude, I strongly <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">believe</MPQAPOL> that parents are our <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">best</MPQAPOL> teachers.</MPQASENT>
