Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From my perspective, those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First and foremost, various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job, but regularly give out creative and novel ideas.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What's more, the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">More importantly, they have activeness, inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Last but not least, the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas.</MPQASENT>
