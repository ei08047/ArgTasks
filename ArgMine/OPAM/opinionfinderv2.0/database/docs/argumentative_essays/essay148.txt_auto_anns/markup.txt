<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Opinions regarding world culture

There are many different opinions regarding world culture.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, in my view, a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data, and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, students who are studying in Iran use the same software, Microsoft, to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries, and students are being encouraged to study in this field.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some people <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">might</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">argue</MPQAPOL> that there are some cultures <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">such</MPQAPOL> as making foods which are unicq in each culture, and technology cannot <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">affect</MPQAPOL> them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">point</MPQAPOL> has some <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">merits</MPQAPOL> on the surface; <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">however</MPQAPOL>, many countries <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">such</MPQAPOL> as Canada, the USA, and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">fact</MPQAPOL>, cooks can find many new food recipes <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">easily</MPQAPOL> on the Internet.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, two days ago, I went to a Canadian restaurant, and I ate noodle, sushi, which are Chinese foods, and Greek salad.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To sum up, new technology has <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">affected</MPQAPOL> cultures of the world, and we can see many similarities in many cultures.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">fact</MPQAPOL>, new technology has influences on <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">educational</MPQAPOL> system, jobs and foods in the world.</MPQASENT>
