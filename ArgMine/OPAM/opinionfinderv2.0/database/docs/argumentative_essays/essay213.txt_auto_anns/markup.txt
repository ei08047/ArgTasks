Nowadays, as the world is getting smaller, we need to be able to cooperate.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Despite the importance of working in team, I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Of course, effective cooperation can make things easier and faster, but in many important cases when team-working is not possible, the ability to work alone will help.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Let's imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people, but you have no experience of working alone, standardized tests such as SAT, TOEFL may be your nightmares.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Testing is a very important aspect of life, and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college, acing your school's final tests, you should consider learning to work on your own.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Everybody in a team must have his/her own opinion first, then discuss them with other members.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When we work in team, we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When everyone in a team can come up with his/her own <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">ideas</MPQAPOL>, working in team will <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">definitely</MPQAPOL> more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">effective</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
