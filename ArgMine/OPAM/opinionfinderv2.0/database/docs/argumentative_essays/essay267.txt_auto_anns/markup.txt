<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">TV has adverse effects on friends and family

Nowdays there are different resources to entertain, educate and inform people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of this resource is television; however television has some negative effects among some people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some People spend a lot of time watching television, others even eat watching television, and some others make of this media a priority.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First of all, some people spend a lot of time watching television.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Instead of spend time with family and friends, they like to seat on a chair for hours.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on, he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work, but he only let her talk during commercials.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">So, she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Time with the family is gold, some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is the time, when if they have children, they can share everything about school, a project and even concerns.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Also, when there is a dinner with friends, some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking, this is not the reality in some cases.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally, some people make the television a priority.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Honestly, I was in shock!</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">How she could say that to me?.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As I have said, television is a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">great</MPQAPOL> tool to learn, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">entertain</MPQAPOL> and inform what is happening, but I <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">agree</MPQAPOL> that television has <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">destroyed</MPQAPOL> communication among <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">friends</MPQAPOL> and family as soon as television become a priority, spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television.</MPQASENT>
