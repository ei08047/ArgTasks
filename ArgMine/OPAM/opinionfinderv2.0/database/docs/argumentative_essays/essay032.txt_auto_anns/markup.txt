In this world, there is no one who does not know this world 'globalization', which means the world are more closer, and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition, a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all, poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In actual, republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Third, the campaigns might include practical benefits.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">When America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I strongly <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">believe</MPQAPOL> that being a global neighbor by aiding <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">poor</MPQAPOL> countries <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> be continues by many organizations and volunteers, and it will make the earth a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">better</MPQAPOL> place to live.</MPQASENT>
