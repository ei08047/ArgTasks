<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Do arts and music improve the quality of life?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Art is not the key determination of quality of life, but education is.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In order to make people better off, it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people's lives for a well-rounded social system.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Admittedly, art, to some extent, serve a valuable function about enriching one's daily lives, for example, it could bring release one's heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries, in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By comparison to these issues, the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To conclude, art <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">could</MPQAPOL> play an <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">active</MPQAPOL> role in <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">improving</MPQAPOL> the quality of people's lives, but I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">think</MPQAPOL> that governments <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> attach heavier weight to other social issues <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">such</MPQAPOL> as education and housing <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">needs</MPQAPOL> because those are the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">most</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">essential</MPQAPOL> ways <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">enable</MPQAPOL> to make people a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">decent</MPQAPOL> life.</MPQASENT>
