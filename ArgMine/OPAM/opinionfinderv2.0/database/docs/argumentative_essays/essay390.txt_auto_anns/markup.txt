Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To some extent, I do not agree with this statement.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First of all, it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone, especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities' world without any talents or achievements.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows, for example; The Voice, X Factor or Next Top Models etc.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">As a result, to become a star and an inspiration for people, a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus, only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore, it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That is the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reason</MPQAPOL> why <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">celebrities</MPQAPOL> nowadays give more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">good</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">influence</MPQAPOL> on young people than they were previously.</MPQASENT>
