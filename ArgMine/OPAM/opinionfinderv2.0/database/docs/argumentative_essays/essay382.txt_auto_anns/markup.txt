<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Technology helps student learn more information and learn more quickly?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nowadays, technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In education, it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From my viewpoint, the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students' progress.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To start with, since technology was introduced, student have been exposed to a wide range of information, which neccessarily broaden their minds.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The internet, for example, provide knowledge in the form of news, radio talks, tapes or reseachs on any particular fields.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There, the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The modern world provides learners with the mp3, the mobile phone or the laptop that help them, especially language learners, listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, students will develop their skills at a greater pace.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, the internet again, is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids, such as educational games, sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On balance, I have to consent to the use of technology in education, as it expedites data availability and accelarates students' learning process.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is highly <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">recommended</MPQAPOL> that apart from education, technology <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be applied in every aspect of life which <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">assures</MPQAPOL> of a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">better</MPQAPOL> future.</MPQASENT>
