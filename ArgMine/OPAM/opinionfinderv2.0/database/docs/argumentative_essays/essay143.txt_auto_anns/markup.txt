<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Successful people do something new or take risks

There is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things, and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some people tend to believe that to be successful, they should do something they are unfamiliar with, while others seem to stand on the opposite place.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I favor the latter; that is, successful people still do things they already know.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that to be successful, we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The lower the factors making us fail we have, the higher probability to success we own.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest, and then just waits for the not so high but constant income.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, we can commence to agree that successful people do not have to try new things or take risks.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At least, a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instance, the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In contrast, those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Admittedly, on the other hands, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that doing something new is necessary for people to success because they can become different from others, which is also a widely accepted idea for success.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Try something new can indeed make people become special, while it does not mean successful.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In other words, reducing risks and enhancing individual's capability is the most important path to success.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Still</MPQAPOL>, I am <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">firmly</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">convinced</MPQAPOL> that the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL> I have proposed in <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">favor</MPQAPOL> of my own <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">sentiment</MPQAPOL> are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">much</MPQAPOL> more tenable and <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">cogent</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
