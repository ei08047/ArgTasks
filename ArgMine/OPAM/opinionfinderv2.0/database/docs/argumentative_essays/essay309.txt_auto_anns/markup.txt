<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Dormitory or apartment?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school, most students always get confused between these two options: living in an apartment, or in university dormitories.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As far as I am concerned, both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the one hand, living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For instance, students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club, or joining sports club.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">In addition, it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question, they can easily ask for help to their roommates, classmates, or teachers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, living off campus prepares students for the real life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, co-operative compared to living in university dormitories.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time, and dealing with the utility bills.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In addition, students also have to focus on their study, and try to maintain their grades higher.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, students also have a chance to know about the community around them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Interacting with the people, and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From given the evidences, it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If I have to choose, I would definitely choose the second option: living in an apartment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">think</MPQAPOL> that it teaches me everything that I <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">certainly</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">wants</MPQAPOL> to learn in my life because learning all those characteristics <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">really</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">help</MPQAPOL> me in leading <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">successful</MPQAPOL> life.</MPQASENT>
