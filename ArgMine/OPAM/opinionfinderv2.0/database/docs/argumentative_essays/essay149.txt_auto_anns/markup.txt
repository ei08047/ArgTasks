There are many factors that contribute to one's success.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, which factor is the most influential one is open to debate.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one's success.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I agree with this statement.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There are a couple of reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First of all, more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did, they can provide more advices and helps in our career.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the past, seldom people have the chance to attend a collage.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, my grandparents did not get a education even in high school, so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood, he had to go to his teacher for help.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Things have changed a lot.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I grow up in a better condition than my father did.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Whenever I have problems, I can always ask my parents for help.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What is more, family members can help us in many other aspects.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university, my father told a lot about different majors.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He shared his own experience with me, which helped me quite a lot.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Parents are quite experienced than their child, they can guide them toward the right direction.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Besides, parents can told their children as many as they can.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What they want is help their child to make a progress.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In a word, our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">believe</MPQAPOL> that with the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">help</MPQAPOL> of our family, we can <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">achieve</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">success</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">quite</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">easily</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
