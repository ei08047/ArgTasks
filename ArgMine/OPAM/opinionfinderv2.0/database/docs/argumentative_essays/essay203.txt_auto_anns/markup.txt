<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Luck vs hard work

There are many instances that luck has brought people things that they never could even imagine.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, I do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one's goals.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore I strongly agree with the argument that it is one's hard work that helps him reach his target.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First, if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments, you are taking a great risk.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Luck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If it doesn't work, it would be a great disappointment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Instead if you strive hard to achieve what you want, then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In my personal experience, all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work, not my luck.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Secondly, if you believe that hard work is the key to success, it would make you a visionary person.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In other words, those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If you believe in luck, you would be clueless about where you are heading.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, a friend of mine, who had severe financial constraints, had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, up to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thirdly, if you work hard, luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, my boss worked tirelessly for his promotion.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He realized that having a master's degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although he had many commitments at home and work, he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship since he had more credentials than other officers in his capacity.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although it is good to be lucky, depending on luck for everything is not good.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hence I strongly <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">believe</MPQAPOL> in <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">hard</MPQAPOL> working that <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> not <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">easily</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">disappoint</MPQAPOL> you as <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">luck</MPQAPOL> sometimes does.</MPQASENT>
