<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some important characteristics of a co-worker

At work, you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you, and in most instances you have to rely on him or her.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The co-workers should be cooperative with one another.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The co-workers need to trust each other.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They should not act on suspicion.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is a very important aspect in the work environment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally, the co-workers should believe in fellowship.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After all, you spend most of your day at office.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you have a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">good</MPQAPOL> company in office, it is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">certainly</MPQAPOL> a <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">blessing</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
