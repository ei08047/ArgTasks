<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Easy preparation of food leads to a better life

The Technology has developed a lot.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With that development, food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With that change, people’s lives are a lot better for several reasons.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, people normally have lots of things to do.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Because of that, they don’t have much time to spend in the kitchen.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For example, if an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Secondly, when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All in all, that ease to prepare food has improved people’s lives.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But people <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">careful</MPQAPOL> with what they eat, because some industrial foods are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">very</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">bad</MPQAPOL> for their health, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">so</MPQAPOL> they <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> buy only food from <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">well</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">known</MPQAPOL> brands.</MPQASENT>
