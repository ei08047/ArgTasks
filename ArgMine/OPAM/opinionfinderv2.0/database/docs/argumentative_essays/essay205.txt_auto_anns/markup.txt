<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Should students be required to attend classes?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, a liberal policy is very feasible.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So an optional attendance saves time and money.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally, psychology knows two types of motivation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To conclude, it is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">clear</MPQAPOL> that going to classes <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be optional for students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I hold this <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">belief</MPQAPOL> due to the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">improvement</MPQAPOL> of students' current experience as <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">well</MPQAPOL> as the <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">valuable</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">skills</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">knowledge</MPQAPOL> they obtain for their whole life afterwards.</MPQASENT>
