<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Several languages are in danger of extinction

It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people, therefore, harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But the others do not believe it is possible.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First and foremost, it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What is more, it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Although governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As evidence of this, there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition, the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a nutshell, I am <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">convinced</MPQAPOL> that all languages <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be preserved and developed as <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">much</MPQAPOL> as <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">possible</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All people <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> give a hand to do this <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">better</MPQAPOL> and governments play a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">vital</MPQAPOL> role on <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">encouraging</MPQAPOL> and distributing those.</MPQASENT>
