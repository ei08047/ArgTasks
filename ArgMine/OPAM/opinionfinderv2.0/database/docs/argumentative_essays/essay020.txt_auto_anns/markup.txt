<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Air pollution

Air pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First, in most industrialized countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second, private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Instead of this, some <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">expensive</MPQAPOL> vehicles cause a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">huge</MPQAPOL> amount of pollution.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">opinion</MPQAPOL>, by charging private individuals for causing air pollution, that will at <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">least</MPQAPOL> contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">believe</MPQAPOL> that governments <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">restrict</MPQAPOL> the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Governments also <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">responsibility</MPQAPOL> to companies and private individuals.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, due to the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">fact</MPQAPOL> that governments are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">responsible</MPQAPOL> to provide a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">healthy</MPQAPOL> environment for their inhabitants and they <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">responsible</MPQAPOL> from cleaning up the air pollution, both companies and private individuals <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> take the main part to clean up the air pollution.</MPQASENT>
