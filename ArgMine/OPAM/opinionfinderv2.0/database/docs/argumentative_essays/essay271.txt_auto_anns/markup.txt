<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Students should attend to classes or it should be optional?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nowadays, it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities (options) as well.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the contrary to this popular belief, there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First and foremost, I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Also, they can help each other for learning materials better.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Finally yet importantly, appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey classâ€™s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Through this way, they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the basis of the points mentioned above, I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Also, attending to classes makes students more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">attentive</MPQAPOL> and have them to do their studies on time that this <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">attitude</MPQAPOL> lead them to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">success</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
