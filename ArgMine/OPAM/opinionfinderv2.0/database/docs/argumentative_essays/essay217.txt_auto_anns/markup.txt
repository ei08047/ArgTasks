<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The best way of learning life

Life is full of challenges, difficulties and unexpected obstacles.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, learning about life, which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On one hand, the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And friends, people who are the same generation with you, they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you, which is not.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By listening to your family and friends advice, you can definitely avoid many unexpected things.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the other hand, finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For one thing, there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don't experience it by yourself.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you did as he told, you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition, family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You will grow to be dependent and reliant.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In contrast, free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">According to myself, both ways are good, but I prefer the latter.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I believe that experiencing the real life by myself, I could learn more than just obey the advice.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves, why don't the younger try to do the same?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In summary, each way learning life has its own benefits.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But to me, learning about life through personal experience <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">seems</MPQAPOL> more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">appropriate</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
