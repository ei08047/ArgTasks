<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The zoo deserves maintenance and public respect

For a long time, the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First of all, the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With zoos, pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of, for instance, a lion or a crocodile.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At a higher level, it is of university students' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which otherwise would not be at hand.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats, which consequently calls for the help of zoos.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What is more, the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as: giraffe, panda, koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In sum, the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is highly <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">recommended</MPQAPOL> that zoos <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be seen with different <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">perspective</MPQAPOL> in order to function at their <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">most</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">efficiency</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
