<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">High schools must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum

Some people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They believe this motivates students to study.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I think, however, students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition, it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To begin with, students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects, otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instance, a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Next, students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">General education plays a significant role in specialized education.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Science today, for example, is said to be more and more specialized, but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In addition, although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects, in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instance, you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Last but not least, students have tendency to shun difficulties.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They might avoid tough courses, but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This might result in limited choices in the future.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, schools should be responsible for their future and protect them.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In summary, students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Besides</MPQAPOL>, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">high</MPQAPOL> school <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">must</MPQAPOL> be <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">responsible</MPQAPOL> for their future with well-planned curriculum.</MPQASENT>
