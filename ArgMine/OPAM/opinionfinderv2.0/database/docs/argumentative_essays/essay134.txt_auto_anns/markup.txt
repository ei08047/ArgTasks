With the increased educational level of workforce, there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Specifically, people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the other hand, it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Besides, organization have been transformed to customers oriented.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To my view, I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yet, the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">importance</MPQAPOL> of social <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">skills</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> not be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">neglected</MPQAPOL> as those <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">skills</MPQAPOL> can <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">help</MPQAPOL> one to perform their job <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">effectiveness</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">efficiency</MPQAPOL> by <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">facilitating</MPQAPOL> interaction and communication with others.</MPQASENT>
