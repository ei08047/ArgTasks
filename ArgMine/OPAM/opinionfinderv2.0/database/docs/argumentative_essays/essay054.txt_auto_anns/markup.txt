<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Museums and art galleries will disappear soon?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology; therefore, some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although modern technology make it possible, I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the one hand, technology indeed simplifies people's life all the time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Obviously, people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, in accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all, authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos, so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages; therefore, these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">admit</MPQAPOL> that <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">modern</MPQAPOL> technology has provided a more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">convenient</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">comfortable</MPQAPOL> manner for people to watch exhibitions, but museums and art galleries are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">necessary</MPQAPOL> to be preserved for its <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">importance</MPQAPOL> of education and culture.</MPQASENT>
