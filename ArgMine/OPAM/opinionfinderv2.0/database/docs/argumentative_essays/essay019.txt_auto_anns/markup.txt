<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some young adults want independence from their parents quickly

Many young adults want to get away from their parent's houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits, to be independent.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult, when they are away from home.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They will have to pay a lot of bills, because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant, who they may not like.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan, electricity, water or even for a meal.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working, because they will not have money to pay for everything.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home, because parents will take care for them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant, who they do not like.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His habits may be totally different from theirs, his behavior may be inappropriate, but they will have to live with him or even share a room, in order to have less expenses.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view, they will not be able to ask him for advice.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore, they are most likely to quarrel every day, instead of to help each other.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, I reckon that for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents, because of the benefits they will have.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They will not <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">need</MPQAPOL> to <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">worry</MPQAPOL> about financial <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">problems</MPQAPOL> or if they will get on <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">well</MPQAPOL> with their roommate.</MPQASENT>
