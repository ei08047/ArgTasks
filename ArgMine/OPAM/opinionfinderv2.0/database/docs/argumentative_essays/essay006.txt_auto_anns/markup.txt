<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Studies abroad and the cultural aspect of the experience

Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do, and they have different reasons for that.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I believe that studying abroad has many advantages.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Students gain a lot out of the experience personally, academically, and culturally.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First of all, students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, students might face many challenges in the host country.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, they will get exposed to a different educational system.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">While living in a foreign country, students can learn a lot about the culture of that country.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, they can meet different people of the country.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They can learn about their way of thinking, their customs and traditions, and way of life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Learning about others' cultures is so important.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It makes us more open, and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Also it educates us about the world we are living in.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, studying abroad does not only have <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advantages</MPQAPOL>, but also can change us in a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">very</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">positive</MPQAPOL> way.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It can influence us in different aspects of life.</MPQASENT>
