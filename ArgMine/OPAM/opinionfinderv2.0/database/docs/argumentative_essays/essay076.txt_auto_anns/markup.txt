<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Government should be responsible for education and health care or not?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Despite the development of modern society, the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens' health care and education.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a result, such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Also, without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, since a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Instead, the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Personally, I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the same time, citizens available for the both <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">encourage</MPQAPOL> the government to allocate money to more <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">urgent</MPQAPOL> areas.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After all, the <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">harmonious</MPQAPOL> society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens.</MPQASENT>
