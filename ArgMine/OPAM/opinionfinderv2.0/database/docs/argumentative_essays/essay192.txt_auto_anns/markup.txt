Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man's life, people might have different preferences: some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends, while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my view, I prefer the second attitude.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others' experiences.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instance, among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport, or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Of course, while differences give the opportunity to learn, they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In fact, in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more, but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In sum, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">although</MPQAPOL> each choice - few <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">close</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">friends</MPQAPOL> or a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">large</MPQAPOL> number of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">friends</MPQAPOL> - presents its <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advantages</MPQAPOL> and its <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">weak</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">points</MPQAPOL>, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">think</MPQAPOL> that spending time with a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">large</MPQAPOL> number of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">friends</MPQAPOL> can add more to one's life.</MPQASENT>
