<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society

Nowadays, the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Personally, I believe such details should be strictly censored, if not banned altogether.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is, more often than that, to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Consequently, a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">An even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans, avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus, without the prevention on criminal details, the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Most importantly, particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Without their consent, this could only add to theses innocent people's mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, I strongly hold my <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">point</MPQAPOL> that any descriptions of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">crimes</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> not go unchecked as any longer, as they may be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">false</MPQAPOL>, may <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">further</MPQAPOL> drive up the already-high <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">crime</MPQAPOL> rate and may bring <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">even</MPQAPOL> more <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">suffering</MPQAPOL> to the victims of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">crimes</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
