<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">People learn in different ways and what teaching method do you prefer?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">People have a lot of things to learn in their lives.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First of all, learning by doing things develops our maturity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When you do things by your self, you learn to depend on yourself.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You will not be in need to refer to books or persons.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader, they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group, or even a situation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With the time, Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">People <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">try</MPQAPOL> and keep <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">trying</MPQAPOL> until they learn what they <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">want</MPQAPOL> to learn.</MPQASENT>
