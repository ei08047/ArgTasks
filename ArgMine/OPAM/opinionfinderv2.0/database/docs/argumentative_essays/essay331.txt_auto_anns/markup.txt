<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity

The city where I was born used to be of a great antique beauty, which was surrounded with by lots of ancient style buildings.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Unfortunately, the unstoppable trend of urbanization makes me only appreciate parts of those classic buildings in the pictures or in museums.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings, some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As far as I am concerned, we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings, letting next generations still have a chance to look at them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Historic buildings have intrinsic values, because they are significant symbols of a city.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Old buildings are reminders of a city's culture and complexity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By seeing historic buildings -- whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic, people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, when somebody mentions Beijing, China's capital city, you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind, because it is the most remarkable sign of the city, and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing, even the entire China.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Depending on the study of Capital Palace, researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, historic buildings make our lives more colorful, provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded, and no rooms for people to relax themselves.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, the warmth of the materials, the heart pine, marble, or the old brick, all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life's little annoyance and feel peaceful.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Meanwhile, historic buildings can be a source of maintenance fees.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There are many historic buildings, such as Beijing Place, Shanghai Artist Museum, they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Our governments will be happy with those efficient consequences, and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Overall, I believe that the city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">However, the preservation of old buildings is a one-way street.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There is no chance to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">renovate</MPQAPOL> to save a history site once it's gone.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This reality brings us to light the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">importance</MPQAPOL> of locating and saving old buildings of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">historic</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">significance</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Therefore</MPQAPOL>, government <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> spend money on preservation of old buildings.</MPQASENT>
