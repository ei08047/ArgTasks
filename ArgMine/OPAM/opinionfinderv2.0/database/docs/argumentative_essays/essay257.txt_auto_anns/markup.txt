<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What's more important: hard work or luck?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What do you think when you see a beautiful building?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And also when you see an airport?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Do you think they have built by chance?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Of course don't.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google, Yahoo etc. created by chance.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success, but to be frank I cannot agree with them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I would explore my primary reasons here.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To begin with, famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hard work make you a professional man/woman which are powerful in his or her job.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I mean, when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He do a lot of exercise in football field every day, so it is not for which he is luckier than me.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So, for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally, you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his/her work.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the end, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">think</MPQAPOL> any <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">great</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">success</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">need</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">great</MPQAPOL> work not <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">great</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">luck</MPQAPOL>, <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">even</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">though</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">luck</MPQAPOL> is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">extraneous</MPQAPOL> and we <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">must</MPQAPOL> not reckon on <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">luck</MPQAPOL> in our plans.</MPQASENT>
