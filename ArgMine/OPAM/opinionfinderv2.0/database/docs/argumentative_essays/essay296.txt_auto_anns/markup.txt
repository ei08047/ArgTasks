<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Technology designed to make people's lives simpler often make them more complicated

Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With newly developing technologies, people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver's license or drive to bank for sending money.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, even with all the conveniences, we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Of course, new technologies are always great.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">However, it takes time for people to adapt them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day, many people often get lost.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For instance, I use new Iphone which I personally think is great.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, even though I used it for couple months, I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At first, I tried to go through all the instructions but, soon, I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Next, technology destroys the language.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others, they created their own language to communicate.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Because people try to type as fast as they are talking, they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This has gotten worse with twitter, myspace, and facebook.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What are even worse, young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To clarify, my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Although</MPQAPOL> technologies <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">allowed</MPQAPOL> us to have a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">convenient</MPQAPOL> life, it has made our lives more <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">chaotic</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">according</MPQAPOL> to the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL> mentioned <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">above</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
