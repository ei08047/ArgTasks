<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media

As a mass media majoring student, I think that it's true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my point of view, disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My reasons include the following:
It is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, journalism is changing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues, paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">First of all, gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports, which seems to tell a story.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content, which can attract the audience.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus, these personal reports of famous people, unimportant information or distorted stories, will not solve problem related with the society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In other words, yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news, such as education, environment and public issues.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Based on the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">above</MPQAPOL> discussion, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">agree</MPQAPOL> with that paying <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">too</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">much</MPQAPOL> attention on personal lives of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">famous</MPQAPOL> people may be a <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">serious</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">problem</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
