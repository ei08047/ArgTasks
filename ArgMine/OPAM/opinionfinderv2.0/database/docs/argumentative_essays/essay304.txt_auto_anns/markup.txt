<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Human needs vs saving land for endangered animals

In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now, for the first time in history, is exceeding seven billion.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing, feeding and industry.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But isn't it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First, the natural diversity is very important for further generations.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To illustrate, every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a result, further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In addition, a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Our behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, there is to say that, given the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">arguments</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">above</MPQAPOL>, we <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">definitely</MPQAPOL> have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">endangered</MPQAPOL> animals but also to preserve our own living conditions.</MPQASENT>
