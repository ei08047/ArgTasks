<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy

The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I will analyze these areas in the essay.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, the major source of energy today is water.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">certainly</MPQAPOL> reduce the global warming.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To conclude, it <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> be a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">better</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">implication</MPQAPOL> by the government to promote other sources of energy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This can make use of the available <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">natural</MPQAPOL> resources which in turn <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> reduce the global warming.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Further</MPQAPOL>, government <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">motivate</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">encourage</MPQAPOL> the people to use alternative sources <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">such</MPQAPOL> as the solar and the nuclear energy.</MPQASENT>
