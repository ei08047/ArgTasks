<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Economic development vs environment

Currently, a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">However, some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Admittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, it may spur its economic development.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the other hand, without the requirement of environmental preservation, the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">firm</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">still</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">consume</MPQAPOL> a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">vast</MPQAPOL> amount of energy which constitutes a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">large</MPQAPOL> part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic development.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Therefore</MPQAPOL>, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> conclude that <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">thriving</MPQAPOL> economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the other hand, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">suppose</MPQAPOL> the developed countries <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">support</MPQAPOL> the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources, technologies and experience <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">so</MPQAPOL> that the environmental <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">problems</MPQAPOL> can be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">effectively</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">alleviated</MPQAPOL> in these areas.</MPQASENT>
