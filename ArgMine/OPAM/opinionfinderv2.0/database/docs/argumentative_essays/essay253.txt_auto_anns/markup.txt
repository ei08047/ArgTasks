<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">How teachers can make the subject interesting to students!</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are many ways of teaching.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching, while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First of all, by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Take chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second, by bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This will address students' interests because it's the assignment that needs real life participation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, in law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">knowledge</MPQAPOL> on a subject is an <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">effective</MPQAPOL> way to attract students' attention and keep them <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">eager</MPQAPOL> on <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">learning</MPQAPOL>, not only because it <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reinforces</MPQAPOL> students' <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">impression</MPQAPOL> on the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">knowledge</MPQAPOL> but also invites students to practice the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">knowledge</MPQAPOL> out on their own.</MPQASENT>
