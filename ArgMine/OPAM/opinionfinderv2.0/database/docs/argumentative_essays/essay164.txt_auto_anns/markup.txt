<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways

It is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Besides the methods, from my point of view, providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">My arguments for this point are listed follows.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Firstly, training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Clearly, in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer, complaining from boss, etc.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends, joking in class, enjoying new knowledge.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Secondly, employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this case, the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">So obviously, they will think about develop long term career with their company.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For another thing, employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don't have this opportunity.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thirdly, providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business, so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Of course, <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">excellent</MPQAPOL> working result will make them <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">very</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">happy</MPQAPOL> as <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">well</MPQAPOL> as their boss.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, providing professional training as a reward for <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">good</MPQAPOL> work has many <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advantages</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Training can <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">help</MPQAPOL> employees <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">refresh</MPQAPOL> their mind as <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">well</MPQAPOL> as make them <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">happy</MPQAPOL>, focus on work.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that training can be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">effective</MPQAPOL> in <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">encouraging</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">further</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">good</MPQAPOL> work.</MPQASENT>
