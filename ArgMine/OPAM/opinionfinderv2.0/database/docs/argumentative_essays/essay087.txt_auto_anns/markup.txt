<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some prefer to work for a company, some prefer to work for themselves

There are many kinds of jobs in society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some of them are done by companies that related to government, and some of them are done by privat companies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages, I would prefer to work for myself, and have my own business.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the first place, there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In your job you can be boss of yourself; however, in the other jobs someone else are your boss.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You always have to be responsible for your task, and it make a stressful situation that I never like it.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What is more, when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves, but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers, and from my point of view it is unfair.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Finally, there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease, sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For all of them we have to ask for a permission, and most of the time we are not allowed.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">There is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages, too, but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They have more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">opportunities</MPQAPOL>, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">profits</MPQAPOL>, and authorities.</MPQASENT>
