<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Technology inspires children's creativity instead of weakening it

Technology accelerates human's evolving pace.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With advanced technology, many things that seemed impossible in the past, have become realities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen, both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, some people point that technology has made children less creative.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I don't deny that technology may have some negative effects on children, but I think technology makes children even more creative.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First, technology inspires children to create new things.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Children are curious about everything around them, so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone, they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer, then he did everything he could to understand how it worked.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After he had figured out all the stuff, he then began to promote the computer.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the end, he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, instead of interfering children's creativity, technology actually encourages children to learn and to create.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Second, technology widen children's knowledge.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the past, children were only able to see things from one perspective.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, with highly advanced technology, children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Knowledge is the base of creativity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world, inspires children and encourage them to create new things.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Admittedly, technology may have negative effects on children.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Technology has made life too easy for most children.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In comfortable conditions, children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nonetheless, with the development of technology, increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They kept researching new technology and became <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">successful</MPQAPOL> at a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">very</MPQAPOL> young age.</MPQASENT>
