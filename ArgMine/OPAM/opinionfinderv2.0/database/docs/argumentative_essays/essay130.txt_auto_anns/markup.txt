<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Under suitable administration, tourism enhances local economic development

Tourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nevertheless, some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction, as a result of tourist activities, and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While both positions seem reasonable, my view is that, through proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore, tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a result, this gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In fact, compared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For instance, paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, the dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">illogical</MPQAPOL> to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">believe</MPQAPOL> that these <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">rational</MPQAPOL> folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">so</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">careful</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">consideration</MPQAPOL> of both sides of the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">argument</MPQAPOL>, the tourism sector is <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">desirable</MPQAPOL> for its <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">important</MPQAPOL> socioeconomic <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advantages</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, it is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">evident</MPQAPOL> that under <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">suitable</MPQAPOL> administration, the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">benefits</MPQAPOL> of tourism outweigh its drawbacks.</MPQASENT>
