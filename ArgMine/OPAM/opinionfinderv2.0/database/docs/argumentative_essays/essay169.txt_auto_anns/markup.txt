<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The precondition of doing research by professors

Nowadays, many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field, the research takes up too much teaching time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As far as I am concerned, professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To begin with, it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The professors’ duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this way, professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the other hand, if professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In this way, hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is adverse to the whole academic field.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Accordingly, spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nevertheless, professors could teach students through research and projects.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some students enjoy taking part in some research.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Through to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For instance, electronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They can manage the electric theory in practical skills.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, only under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is requires professors provide <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">high</MPQAPOL> quality courses.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In other word, professor <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">concern</MPQAPOL> about preparing class.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Consequently</MPQAPOL>, conducting research is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">helpful</MPQAPOL> for professors and students to some extent.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">However</MPQAPOL>, the precondition of doing research is growing students’ <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">solid</MPQAPOL> theory <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">fundamental</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Only by developing students, can we have a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">better</MPQAPOL> academic field.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Professors <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">could</MPQAPOL> combine doing research and preparing <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">good</MPQAPOL> courses in a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">dynamic</MPQAPOL> way.</MPQASENT>
