<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Influence of English - advantages outweigh the disadvantages

In the present age, it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people claim it's a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Personally, I agree with the former opinion.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To begin with, communication between countries and cultures become convenient.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In my country, English is a required course from elementary school.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus, studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For them, language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This, in turn, enhances relationship and promotes international business.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As a result, they have no choice but choosing English as a second language.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Admittedly, opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hence, the culture heritage and nation identity vanish.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, in <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">spite</MPQAPOL> of some <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">negative</MPQAPOL> effects, I'm totally <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">convinced</MPQAPOL> that the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">prevalent</MPQAPOL> usage of English brings <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">benefits</MPQAPOL> to people and countries all around.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">suggest</MPQAPOL> all youths <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> learn English owing to its <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">key</MPQAPOL> role in globalization.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But at the same time, actions, like recording, can be taken to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">protect</MPQAPOL> native languages and cultures.</MPQASENT>
