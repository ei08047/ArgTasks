<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Should people be forced to stop working?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The appropriate age at which a person should stop working is now a much debated issue in the society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some opine that people should be given the option to choose when they want to call it a day while others oppose this notion.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my personal point of view, the right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I, for one, strongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age due to several reasons that I shall discuss below.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First and foremost, if senior workers dominate the working sector, there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a result, most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To illustrate this further, a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day, he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On top of that, due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option, there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Apart from that, not all elderly workers are physically well.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Beyond that age, a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To cite an example, the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Consequently, they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Besides, the academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills, resulting in more loss for the institution.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus, it would indeed be better if at an older age, opportunities are given to the younger ones.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Admittedly, the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Their invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering, medicine, and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hence, it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, it is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There will come a certain time when the older generation should hand over the responsibility to the fresh comers who are certainly waiting to be given a choice to prove themselves.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After all, retirement not only marks the end of an individual, but also gives him a chance to make up for what he has <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">lost</MPQAPOL> throughout his working life.</MPQASENT>
