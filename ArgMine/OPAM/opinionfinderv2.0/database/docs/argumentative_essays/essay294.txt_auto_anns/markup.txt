<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Professors should do more research or teach students?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These days, more and more university professors are involved in scientific research.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, according to my experiences, professors should be encouraged to mainly do research.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all, doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Universities are relatively fenced environment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The research projects provide communication with the outside.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition, by doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was often invited to do speech in other universities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Although my university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The research projects like windows opened to the wider world.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Also, you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Consequently, there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Universities positively contribute the professors' success.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Last but not least, doing research could also improve the teaching quality.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For those <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL>, it is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">natural</MPQAPOL> to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">support</MPQAPOL> the professors spending more time on doing research.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">While extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society.</MPQASENT>
