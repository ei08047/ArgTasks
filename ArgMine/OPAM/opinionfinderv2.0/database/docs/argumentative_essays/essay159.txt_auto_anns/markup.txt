<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Popularity of mobile phones to young people

Nowadays, many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Despite all these positive aspects, I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all, many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time, leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Similarly, internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In my college days, I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Relatively, these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore, most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days, wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a personâ€™s education and character.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Therefore</MPQAPOL>, I highly <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">discourage</MPQAPOL> the young ones to be overly <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">dependent</MPQAPOL> on mobile phones.</MPQASENT>
