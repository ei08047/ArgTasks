<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">University students should attend classes or not?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In university education, students are given much independence in the ways of learning.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses, while some students don't feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First, in terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Professors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second, it's students' basic responsibility to attend class.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many professors grade their students with class attendances.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In other words, class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Why wasting time going to classes?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Doesn't self-study more efficient?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">However, in my opinion, this is a rather immodest way of thinking.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Besides, even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It's an essential learning process.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">learning</MPQAPOL> process itself, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">however</MPQAPOL>, is the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">most</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">important</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">powerful</MPQAPOL> way of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">evaluating</MPQAPOL> a student.</MPQASENT>
