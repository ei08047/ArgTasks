<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Why should human beings travel to outer space?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For many centuries, outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, to illustrate, astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, many facts about solar system can be discovered.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For instance, a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, people can know more about the planet earth itself.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Finally, a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Oxygen tanks, for instance, are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">proved</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">useful</MPQAPOL> not only in outer space but also underwater.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Moreover</MPQAPOL>, spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As a conclusion, I personally <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">think</MPQAPOL> that human beings <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> travel to outer space.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">spite</MPQAPOL> of costing a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">fortune</MPQAPOL>, space exploration has given aforementioned <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">benefits</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
