<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Growing traffic and pollution can be controlled by increasing petrol prices

As we read newspapers or watch TV, we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues, air and water pollution questions.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching, it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems, though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Specifically, price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area; however, whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On one hand, governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Consequently, it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the other hand, pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In addition, the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">adequate</MPQAPOL>, while <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">improving</MPQAPOL> transportation facilities and building supervisory institution <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> be <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">preferable</MPQAPOL>, plus with the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">awareness</MPQAPOL> of environmental <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">protection</MPQAPOL> being raised.</MPQASENT>
