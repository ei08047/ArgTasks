<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Government should regard investing in building roads as the most important

The population explosion results in the high demands of transportation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many countries have suffered from pollution, noisy and casualty for a long time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First and foremost, we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Most importantly, there are many accidents happening on the roads.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, in my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Each year, Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For instance, I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In contrast, if the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Last but not least, spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a nutshell, the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I am usually inclined to this <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">idea</MPQAPOL> and I <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">hope</MPQAPOL> that the government will <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">regard</MPQAPOL> the investment in building roads as the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">most</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">important</MPQAPOL> thing.</MPQASENT>
