<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Is a break good or bad after high school for students

Studies are an essential part of life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In most education systems, a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Working or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It will also help them to learn professional setup by working.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Financially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, there are also disadvantages.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When he started his university studies, he failed miserably.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But, the break should be an optional thing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A break gives students more benefits than harms.</MPQASENT>
