<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Tv has NO negative effects on children

Nowadays, we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Many people say that television has negative effects on children, since it can be violent or inappropriate for children.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are two reasons to support my idea.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all, television has useful and educational programs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, in Korea, there's program called EBS.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is targeted for children to teenager.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We can study subjects through EBS lecture.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Also, there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition, Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are many Tv programs such as sports programs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Many children have a lot of stresses recently, since they have so much pressure about study.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As an example, I got too much stress from the school.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So, I was quite aggressive, however.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Instead, this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school, since it helped me to relieve my stress.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, of course, the television can have violent programs, however, if children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now that, it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For these <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL>, I strongly <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">disagree</MPQAPOL> with the statement that television has <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">negative</MPQAPOL> effects on children.</MPQASENT>
