<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Do married women usually work?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Why and why not?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Personally, I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I will mention some basic reasons as following.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So, it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These things in turn will make them more confident, independent.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These women will set a good example for their children.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Last but not least, nowadays, there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, a well-organized home does not <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">need</MPQAPOL> the housewife's presence the whole day long and married women <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">could</MPQAPOL> go to work in order to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">enjoy</MPQAPOL> the working life outside the home.</MPQASENT>
