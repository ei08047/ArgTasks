<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Educated high-school students with bright and independent mind

High school is the time when you decide your future career and particular field you want to concentrate and interested in.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice, to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First of all, as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Next, students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Also, we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Lastly, the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she/he has an aptitude.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore, this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, as a young women I <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">want</MPQAPOL> my children to get <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">knowledge</MPQAPOL> they have <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">desire</MPQAPOL> to study in order to have <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">distinguished</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">achievement</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">so</MPQAPOL> it has <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advantage</MPQAPOL> not only for him or her but for society as <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">well</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Having three <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">helps</MPQAPOL> us to bring up students who are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">well-educated</MPQAPOL>, with a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">bright</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">independent</MPQAPOL> mind.</MPQASENT>
