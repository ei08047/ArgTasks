<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Serious or entertaining movies

I prefer the serious movies which are simple, touching and powerful.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Here are my reasons.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First, most serious movies have a wide variety of content.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Entertaining movies are created to amuse people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Compared with the entertainment film, the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love, humaneness; moreover, it may point out the dark sides of the society.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Second, not all of serious movies are boring.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">"Click" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The movie is humorous and satiric,which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives, and it reminds us how important our families are.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus, the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">"Blood diamond", an adaptation of a real story in South Africa, focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After watching the movie, we may learn a lesson between jewels and death.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love; indeed, the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a result, serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">above</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL>, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">prefer</MPQAPOL> to see those <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">serious</MPQAPOL> movies which make people have <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">deep</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">thoughts</MPQAPOL> toward their <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">real</MPQAPOL> lives.</MPQASENT>
