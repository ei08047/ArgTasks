<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Keeping animals in zoos

Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, both of the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">arguments</MPQAPOL> have <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">strong</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">supports</MPQAPOL>, but in my own <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">view</MPQAPOL>, more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">good</MPQAPOL> come from zoos than <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">bad</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">However</MPQAPOL>, it is <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">hoped</MPQAPOL> that the standards of zoos <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be leveled up to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">ensure</MPQAPOL> that the animals in zoos are provided with <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">good</MPQAPOL> care and attention.</MPQASENT>
