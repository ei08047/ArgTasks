<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Artists' freedom to express ideas

Artists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nevertheless, some argue that there should be government restrictions in order to limit their opinions.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I however, agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First and foremost, if there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In short, without any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore, it is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Today, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To illustrate this further, the famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus, human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Looking from another perspective, there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To cite an example, Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nonetheless, I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To conclude, it is now evident that there should not be any restrictions on artists' work.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves as ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hence, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">even</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">though</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">freedom</MPQAPOL> to express <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">ideas</MPQAPOL> can bring some <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">negative</MPQAPOL> effects, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">certainly</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">believe</MPQAPOL> that there are many <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">wonderful</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">beautiful</MPQAPOL> Arts due to the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">freedom</MPQAPOL> to express <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">ideas</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">thus</MPQAPOL>, I strongly <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">believe</MPQAPOL> there <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be no <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">restrictions</MPQAPOL> on them.</MPQASENT>
