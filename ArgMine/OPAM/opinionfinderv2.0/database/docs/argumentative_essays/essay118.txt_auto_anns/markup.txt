<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Whether athletes and singers are overpaid?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social, economic fields.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all, some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training, let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition, although there are many singers and athletes, few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Overcoming all these obstacles, they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, their talents should not be overrated.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Other people say that singers and athletes, in fact, contribute insignificantly to the development of the society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While scientists invent machines serving daily lives, doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation, singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Indeed</MPQAPOL>, their <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">contribution</MPQAPOL> is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">less</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">important</MPQAPOL> than those from doctors or scientists, albeit <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">necessary</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hence, their <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">privilege</MPQAPOL> of salary <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">seems</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">groundless</MPQAPOL>, while the main work forces receive <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">modest</MPQAPOL> salaries which only <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">enable</MPQAPOL> them to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">afford</MPQAPOL> bare necessities.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From all analysis <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">suggested</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">above</MPQAPOL>, professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">contributions</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">think</MPQAPOL> that there <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields, namely science and society, who are the driving forces for the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">prosperity</MPQAPOL> of the nation.</MPQASENT>
