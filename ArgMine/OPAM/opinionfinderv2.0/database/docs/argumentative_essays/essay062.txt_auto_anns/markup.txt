<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Should universities accept equal number of males/females or not

Education is important for the development of the world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Right to education is a basic human right of both, males and females.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Unfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Equality in education will help in development of the society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">superior</MPQAPOL> or <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">inferior</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Choice of course <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">discretion</MPQAPOL> of the student and their <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">merit</MPQAPOL>, irrespective of the gender.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Educational <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">rights</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">must</MPQAPOL> be given to both genders.</MPQASENT>
