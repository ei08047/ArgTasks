<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First, when it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Alternatively, if you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Second, technology also makes teaching simpler.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once.</MPQASENT>
