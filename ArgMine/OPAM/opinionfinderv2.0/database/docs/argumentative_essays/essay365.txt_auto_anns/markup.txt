<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Way to reduce the amount of traffic?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The problem off traffic overload, caused by overpopulation, has aroused interest of many city planners.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all, public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Apparently, a bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Together, they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second, rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a rule of thumb, huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is highly <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">recommended</MPQAPOL> to put forward <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">such</MPQAPOL> solution, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">especially</MPQAPOL> in some developing countries like Vietnam or China, with the ever-growing <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">demand</MPQAPOL> for job or education.</MPQASENT>
