<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Prevention is better than cure

It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Once applied, it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all, thank to a full health education from their childhoods, children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age, he also keeps it when older.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Secondly, health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Instead of afraid or panic, they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For example, vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu, smallpox, rubella so on.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country, the community's health state will be improved remarkably.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As human resources play a key role in the development of a country, investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition, because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention, the government can save a lot of money for our country's health budget.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, I strongly <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">agree</MPQAPOL> that we <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">However</MPQAPOL>, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasonable</MPQAPOL> attentions <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be paid to treatment <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">so</MPQAPOL> that our citizens are always <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">looked</MPQAPOL> after with <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">best</MPQAPOL> services.</MPQASENT>
