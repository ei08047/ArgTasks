<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Attending university classes should be required or optional

Attending university's classes is one of activities that students have to do.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, class is not the only source of knowledge.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Students also learn from other sources such as experience, libraries and other people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Firstly, the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus, she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Finally, she got very good grade when she was graduation.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Secondly, students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In my experience, many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Also, I had already studied all biology topics before attending university.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a result, I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Also, they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">So</MPQAPOL> that, attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore.</MPQASENT>
