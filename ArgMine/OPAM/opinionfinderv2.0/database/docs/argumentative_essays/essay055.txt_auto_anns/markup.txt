<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Should teenagers learn all school subjects/focus on one subject

Presently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">pressure</MPQAPOL> and foster the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">effectiveness</MPQAPOL> in training <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">talents</MPQAPOL>, while its shortfalls are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">so</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">vital</MPQAPOL> to students' future.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Therefore</MPQAPOL>, I do <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">support</MPQAPOL> the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">view</MPQAPOL> of learning all school subjects.</MPQASENT>
