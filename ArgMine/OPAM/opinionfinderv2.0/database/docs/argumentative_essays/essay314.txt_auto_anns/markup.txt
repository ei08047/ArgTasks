<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Extraordinarily cautious is important since rough work is intolerable

This current world we situate ourselves in is rather unpredictable, even one sudden invention could bring down all the notions we used bear in mind.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Most of us has endeavored to keep up with the pace of the development of today's world in fast pace.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I personally believe that even when fast pace may be the wise move to correspond with today's world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, it might not be the most beneficial move to our society.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Primarily, even when the world operates in fast pace, it still requires accuracy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes, we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In short, it only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Certainly it may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times, but with consistent work soon enough we'll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, other than the importance of accuracy, the world also seeks efficiency, which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Even when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project, this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace since when the problem reveals itself we'll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Besides, when looking at this problem within a broader image.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all, for instance, in official missions like the work done by NASA, a tiny mistake can be catastrophic.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In such circumstances, even when the scientists want to finish off quickly, but they couldn't miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">To sum up, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">even</MPQAPOL> when we <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">need</MPQAPOL> to catch up with the pace of the world, it is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">necessary</MPQAPOL> for us to be <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">extraordinarily</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">cautious</MPQAPOL> since <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">rough</MPQAPOL> work is <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">intolerable</MPQAPOL> when we <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">want</MPQAPOL> to stay <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">competitive</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
