<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Paying taxes is enough contribution from citizens

Paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Personally, I tend to disagree with this view.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To start with, all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, as it is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although these workers do not produce profit directly, what they do is for the well-being of the whole society.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">As we know, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, but such financial help is usually far from enough.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In such case, aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">So</MPQAPOL> it is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">quite</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">necessary</MPQAPOL> for the local residents to take actions and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">ensure</MPQAPOL> the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">suspicious</MPQAPOL> activities to the police department.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, it is a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">significant</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">obligation</MPQAPOL> of citizens to pay tax to the government.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Other than that, they have other <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">critical</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">obligations</MPQAPOL> to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way.</MPQASENT>
