In many countries, children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, some people think it's not a good educational measure.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From my point of view, the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all, children can learn about the hardship of earning money.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies, doing housework and keeping shops, they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, they are likely to understand their parents' hardship, to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Secondly, when children take jobs, they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To keep their jobs, children will have to try their best to finish their duties.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, if a child works as a shop assistant, he will have to keep an eye on good and products, calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people may argue that children will be more material, neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, if children get good care and instructions from their parents, they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents' permission, they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">recommend</MPQAPOL> that parents <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">help</MPQAPOL> their children to choose a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">suitable</MPQAPOL> job which does not <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">affect</MPQAPOL> their children 's study and that the government <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> have <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">right</MPQAPOL> policies to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">avoid</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">exploiting</MPQAPOL> children's labour.</MPQASENT>
