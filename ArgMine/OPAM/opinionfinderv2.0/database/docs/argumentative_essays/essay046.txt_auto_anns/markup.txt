<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">True function of a university

Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">helpful</MPQAPOL>, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">however</MPQAPOL>, if <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">certain</MPQAPOL> courses <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">concerning</MPQAPOL> workplace <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">skills</MPQAPOL> can also be made available to students to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">help</MPQAPOL> shape their futures.</MPQASENT>
