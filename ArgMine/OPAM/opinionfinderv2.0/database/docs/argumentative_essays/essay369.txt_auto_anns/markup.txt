<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Tourism: good or bad?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Tourism, since its first appearance a long time ago, can be described as a controversial celebrity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion, environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">However, I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all, tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Basically, places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas, of which economy, before their appearance, haven't blossmed yet.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It will, by all means, attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In other word, tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction, which exploit the best out of its own potential.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, even though environmental damage is inevitable, it is not tourism to be blamed for.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction, the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">To be precise, for instance, a fortune is spent on trimming the trees, watering the flowers, preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora, in the hope of beautifying the wild.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not to mention ecotourism, a new kind of environment-friendly service, which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Because of that, tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">All thing considered, tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In my <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">opinion</MPQAPOL>, the combination of tourism and teaching process is highly <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">recommended</MPQAPOL> in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between human and their surroundings.</MPQASENT>
