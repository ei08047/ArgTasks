<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Should all the advertisements be banned?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My view is that while some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">First, it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In fact, they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Besides, it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In a larger sense, it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That is not to say, however, that advertisements have no downsides.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Of course, the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yet, its merits still outweigh these downsides.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Taken all together, advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We can not deny all of them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">However</MPQAPOL>, if those with exaggerated and <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">fake</MPQAPOL> information <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">could</MPQAPOL> be banned, advertisements <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> be <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">welcomed</MPQAPOL> by more.</MPQASENT>
