<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up.</MPQASENT>
