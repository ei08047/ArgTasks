<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Are museums necessary?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary, even though we can see the art works and historical objects online.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We can browse the art work from all over the world at home.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By contrast, the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, only when we see the real mummy, can we experience mystique.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits, museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, at American Museum of Natural History, you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum's stegosaurus; at Museum of Art in New York, you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While if you "visit" the museum online, you may not able to get this kind of experience.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For instance, you can't see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What's more, not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">believe</MPQAPOL> we <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">still</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">need</MPQAPOL> museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">help</MPQAPOL> visitors to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">know</MPQAPOL> more about the art works or historical objects.</MPQASENT>
