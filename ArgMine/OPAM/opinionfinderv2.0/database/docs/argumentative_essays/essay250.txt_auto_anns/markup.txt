<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Should we pay professional athletes (entertainers) a high salary?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Professional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From my prospect, I believe that they do deserve this high payment.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all, a worker's salary can properly reflect his/her competence and value on his/her career.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They are not paid for no reason.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As we are now live in a competent world, we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It's all the same in every profession.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That's why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields, namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Second, such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete's great performances.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they've gone through and how much cost they've thrown into investing themselves.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They shall reap within their high salaries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In other words, if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances, there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, in my opinion, as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his/her dreams and careers, that would be fair.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">positive</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">encouragement</MPQAPOL> for many more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">talented</MPQAPOL> people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment, giving us <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">awesome</MPQAPOL> performances to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">enjoy</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
