<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Improving facilities is the best way

There is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers, and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities, while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I favor the former; that is, I prefer to spend money on improving facilities.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have, the more chances we can increase our knowledge.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, library is a good place for students to study or research.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They have numerous activities in school.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Based on the reasons demonstrate above, I believe that improving facilities is the best way for school because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In other words, students can procure more advantages from better facilities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Still</MPQAPOL>, I an <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">firmly</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">convinced</MPQAPOL> that the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL> I have proposed in <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">favor</MPQAPOL> of my <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">sentiment</MPQAPOL> are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">much</MPQAPOL> more tenable and <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">cogent</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
