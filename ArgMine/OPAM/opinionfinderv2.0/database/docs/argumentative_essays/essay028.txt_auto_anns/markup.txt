<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Society should ban all forms of the advertising

It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Other critics say that ads have no purpose, they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First of all, I do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose whatâ€™s the best for us.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, I think that modern society needs advertising.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Ads will keep us <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">well</MPQAPOL> informed about new products and services, but we <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">definitely</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">affect</MPQAPOL> our children in <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">negative</MPQAPOL> way.</MPQASENT>
