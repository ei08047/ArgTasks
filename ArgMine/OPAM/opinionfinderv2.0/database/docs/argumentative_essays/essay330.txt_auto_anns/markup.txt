<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In personal live, we have some responsibilities towards other people

People should sometimes do things, even though they don't enjoy it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is basic part of the lives.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There may be small or big things, but at last people should accept them, because most of them is about responsibilities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In this essay, the reasons for why I agree that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing will be explored.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Firstly, most people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing.<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In personal live, we have some responsibilities towards to other people, there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instance, housework is very difficult for me, although my husband helps me some of them, but it is my responsibility.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I really don't like any of them, however I should do.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly,professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Nobody likes attending boring conferences, or working a person who isn't well in with anyone.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I'm a research asistant at a university, and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn't good at human relationships, most of the asistans don't enjoy to talk with him about any situation, although we have to ask about his field.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thirdly, doing something which an individual doesn't enjoy can led to enjoyment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don't really want.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don't like.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After insisting on some of our friends, we attended, and got really enjoyable time, we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Nobody has a life with a lot of fun; there are sometimes <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">unpleasant</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">boring</MPQAPOL> parts which is not <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">liked</MPQAPOL> by anyone, but <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">most</MPQAPOL> of them are about <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">responsibilities</MPQAPOL> which is the part of individual's <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">live</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
