<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy

The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Last but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Thus</MPQAPOL> I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">suggest</MPQAPOL> that use of nuclear technology <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">discouraged</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">even</MPQAPOL> for <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">civil</MPQAPOL> purposes.</MPQASENT>
