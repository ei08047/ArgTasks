<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Parents are the best teachers because they are more special than everybody else

I completely agree that parents are the best teacher.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children’s lives.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, the things that parents say have great power to their child.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">More power than any friend or other adult could have.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn't do it, but his father told him/her that it was right, the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person, even if his father is wrong.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Secondly, a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people, so their parents have more time to teach him/her than anybody else.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They have more contact and more intimacy with their children.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lastly, children usually mirror themselves on their parents.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That’s as important thing because even if the parents don’t intend to teach their children something, they are always observing and learning by themselves.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">So, if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad, his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All in all, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">agree</MPQAPOL> that parents are the <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">greatest</MPQAPOL> teachers and I <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">think</MPQAPOL> that they <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">very</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">careful</MPQAPOL> with what they say and do in front of their child, because it can define who he is going to be.</MPQASENT>
