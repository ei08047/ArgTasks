<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Distance-learning vs. attending school in person

A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">However</MPQAPOL>, discussions and interactions <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be held via video conferencing frequently <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">so</MPQAPOL> that the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">joy</MPQAPOL> of learning <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> not be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">diminished</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
