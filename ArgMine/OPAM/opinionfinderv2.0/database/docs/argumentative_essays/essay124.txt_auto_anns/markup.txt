You hardly ever can find a person who says that he or she had unpleasant childhood.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When individuals reminisce their memories they absolutely infer to some of their childhood events.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As much as their events might were bitter, in their adulthood they are sweet.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the first place, children are free whatever they want to do, they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition, in this age they are not expected to be responsible.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Also, they do not have to educate and they do not have to work, so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a matter of fact, I made a large number of friends in this age, and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Also I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age.</MPQASENT>
