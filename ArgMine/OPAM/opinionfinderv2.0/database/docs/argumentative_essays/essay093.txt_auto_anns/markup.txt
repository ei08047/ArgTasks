<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Should wealthy nations support poor ones?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones, by means of providing infrastructures, or remain bystander of the global poverty, is an issue of controversy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Personally I think, as the privileged minority, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In terms of ethics, it is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help, especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Compassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Economically speaking, such aid could also create a win-win situation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In summary, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">wealthy</MPQAPOL> nations' offering in <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">need</MPQAPOL> is not only a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">moral</MPQAPOL> deed, but also a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">worthwhile</MPQAPOL> one which will one day pay off in other ways.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Only those who <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">sympathize</MPQAPOL> with their fellowman can <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">prosper</MPQAPOL> in the long run.</MPQASENT>
