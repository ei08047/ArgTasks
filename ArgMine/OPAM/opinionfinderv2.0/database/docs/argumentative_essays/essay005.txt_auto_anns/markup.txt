<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Living and studying overseas

It is every student's desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">While some students study and live overseas to achieve this, some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself/herself into new environments and situations in life.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness, living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Also, employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Therefore</MPQAPOL>, one who has studied and lived overseas will become more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">eligible</MPQAPOL> for the job than his/her peers.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, there are many <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">difficulties</MPQAPOL> a student <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">might</MPQAPOL> face when studying and living overseas.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">However</MPQAPOL>, living and studying overseas gives the individual a new <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">perspective</MPQAPOL> on the subject that is studied or in general life.</MPQASENT>
