It goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Their success should be attributed to many different external factors.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, in my opinion, the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To add up, when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such, classmates are second to none.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents, explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others; it can be, for example, lessons on the class, social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sharing the same age, children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas, to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments, resulting in deeper comprehension.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advantages</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">considered</MPQAPOL>, classmates are unrivalled by the children's parents as they provide <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">tremendous</MPQAPOL> incentive and horizon expansion, two crucial commodities leading to a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">successful</MPQAPOL> presentation at school.</MPQASENT>
