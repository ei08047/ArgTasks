<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">International aid

The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My view is that international aid should be prioritised.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders, it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After all, charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Another reason is that, even within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, people from <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">unfortunate</MPQAPOL> countries <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">need</MPQAPOL> more international assistance while <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">helping</MPQAPOL> citizens in the home country is also <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">necessary</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
