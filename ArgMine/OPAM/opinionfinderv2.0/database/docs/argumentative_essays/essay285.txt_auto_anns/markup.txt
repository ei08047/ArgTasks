<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Should replace normal classroom with online computer classes?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are many advantages of distance learning, but it should not replace classroom learning.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Learning in classroom could provide more information to study.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Besides, learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills, and learning how to solve problem in real situation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Consequently, I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I will give reasons to support my opinion.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To begin with, learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, in biology class, learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Unlike classroom, online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, online class could not provide knowledge about social skills.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For instance, In a classroom, teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lastly, learning in classroom, student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If student do it by themselves, they might be hurt themselves.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Because, classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Besides, classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Thus</MPQAPOL>, having classroom <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">could</MPQAPOL> provide <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">abundant</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">skills</MPQAPOL> to students.</MPQASENT>
