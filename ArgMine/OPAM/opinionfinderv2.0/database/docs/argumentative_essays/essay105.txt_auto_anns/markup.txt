<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Should the cost of medicines be reduced?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At present, a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Admittedly, more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">With advanced technology, the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines, which can cure a variety of serious illnesses.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs, their health situations may be better.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, the current cost of medicines is , in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Apparently, the process of researching, testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, these products prove to ensure human health completely.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs, they would make no profit, even running up debt because of production expenditure.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, the measure cannot be adopted, otherwise those companies will go into liquidation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In short, this is not a long-term solution.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Fortunately, there are other measures to improve the situation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Additionally, charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines, which may exacerbate their qualities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Instead, the government and medical foundations <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">responsible</MPQAPOL> for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">reasonable</MPQAPOL> price.</MPQASENT>
