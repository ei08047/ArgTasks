There are many advantage of these invention, telephones and email.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication, telephones and email, made people less personal.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I will give several reasons to support my opinion.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To begin with, telephones and email help people, who live far away from other people, to connect each other.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Unlike email, send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, right now, I am in the U.S.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents, who live in my country.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Consequently, I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Second, using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instant, sometime when I argue with my friends, I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So, when I have a time to realize what had happened, I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus, these types of communications make me feel personal.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Telephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Beside, I could express my personal thought through telephones and email.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As a result, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">believe</MPQAPOL> that telephones and email do not make communication between people <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">less</MPQAPOL> personal.</MPQASENT>
