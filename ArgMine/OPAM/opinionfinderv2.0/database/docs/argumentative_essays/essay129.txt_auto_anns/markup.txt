<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Living in a higher pace is better

There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks, while others seem to prefer the opposite position.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I favor the former; that is, I prefer to live in a higher pace condition.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For instance, I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hence, from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In contrast, it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In other words, I prefer to live in high pace.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is not to say, of course that other points of view are totally without merit.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Still</MPQAPOL>, I am <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">firmly</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">convinced</MPQAPOL> that the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL> I proposed in <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">favor</MPQAPOL> of my own <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">sentiment</MPQAPOL> are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">much</MPQAPOL> more tenable and <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">plausible</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
