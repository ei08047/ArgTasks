<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">E-mail or Voice mail Versus Telephone or face to face

Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You can talk to others from thousands mile.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If the address is wrong, then you will know right away.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Last but not least, every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the whole, to compare to all ways of communication, I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Its convenience saves our time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Additionally, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">honesty</MPQAPOL> is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">necessary</MPQAPOL> for every conversation and also fluency can't be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">missing</MPQAPOL> for a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">persuasive</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">expression</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
