<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">People have various different views about cheap air travel.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.</MPQASENT>
