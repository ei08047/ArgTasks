<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Television and Movies influence our lives both negatively and positively

There is no doubt that television or movies influence people’s behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They make people to eat more rubbish food, spend less time with their friends and family, and be someone that are not themselves.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people’s health.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In turn, people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends, especially children.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When people are watching television or movies together, they also talk less to each other, compare to when playing social games, such as parlor games, together.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Television and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements, they think that they are ugly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him, then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don’t prefer it.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">think</MPQAPOL> television and movies are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">entertaining</MPQAPOL> but <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">most</MPQAPOL> of the time they influence people’s behavior in <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">bad</MPQAPOL> ways.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">want</MPQAPOL> to stay <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">healthy</MPQAPOL>, be yourself and spend time with your family and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">friends</MPQAPOL>, then you <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> spend less time watching these media.</MPQASENT>
