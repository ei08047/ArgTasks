<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Should we require our young children to learn music and art

Every parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In order to achieve this, they start cultivating their children when they are very young.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In addition to basic knowledge like language or science, music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First, it's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Second, music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They are essential to our spiritual life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, some people might argue that parents shouldn't put so much stress on children, since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this way, it will not be such pressure on children.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, young age is the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">perfect</MPQAPOL> time for children to learn music and art and they are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">indeed</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">valuable</MPQAPOL> to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Music and art can accompany a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">spirit</MPQAPOL> as long as they are given the chance to enter his/her life.</MPQASENT>
