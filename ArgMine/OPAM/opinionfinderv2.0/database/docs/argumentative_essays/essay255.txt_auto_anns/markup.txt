<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The car use will definitely decrease in twenty years

Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen, the car use will decrease.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But as far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea, which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The following reasons will present my points.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all, since the public transportation has improved, it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So, with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Second, a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">So, with the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, instead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Although, I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can't meet every place.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Of course, it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this way, this won't be a problem at all.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, given the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL> described <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">above</MPQAPOL>, when the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advantages</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">disadvantages</MPQAPOL> of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared, the <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">best</MPQAPOL> choice is <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">obviously</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">stand</MPQAPOL> on my side, which is that the car use will <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">definitely</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">decrease</MPQAPOL> in twenty years.</MPQASENT>
