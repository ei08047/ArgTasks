<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Physical exercise

Although some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics, I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Physical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all, the ancient Latin proverb says: "Anima sana in corpore sano", which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The more we practice, the better we feel.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Additionally, there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So, if the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Besides, when we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, when a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Alike, the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Last, but not least, financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For instance, the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare, since the nation is comparatively healthy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Along with that, physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a matter of fact, the better a person feels, the better his brain works.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As hence it ends up with financially competitive country.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the conclusion, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">like</MPQAPOL> to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">problem</MPQAPOL> of physical education, the more <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">influence</MPQAPOL> we can get on academic <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">success</MPQAPOL> of students.</MPQASENT>
