<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Can technology alone solve the world's environmental problems?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the following paragraphs, I intend to discuss both viewpoints.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If successful, the impact on the world would be monumental.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It would mean another industrial revolution.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, technology alone can solve the world's environmental problems.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life.</MPQASENT>
