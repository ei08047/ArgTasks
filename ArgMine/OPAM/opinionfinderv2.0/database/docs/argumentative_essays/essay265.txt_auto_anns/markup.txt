<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The ability to relate well to people is more important

I think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We should consider many factors and choose the best of them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons:
We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This can be done in school.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As you can see, studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Commuincation can bring many benefits.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, if you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well, you can achieve your goal.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Or, if you are a salesman in a store or any other place, by relating well to your customers, you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So, relating well to people is also another important factor.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In sum, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">though</MPQAPOL> some people may <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">disagree</MPQAPOL> with me, as I explained my <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL> and examples <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">above</MPQAPOL>, none of those factors are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">important</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">sufficient</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">enough</MPQAPOL> by themselves and we <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> notice to both of them because each of them has its own <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">benefits</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
