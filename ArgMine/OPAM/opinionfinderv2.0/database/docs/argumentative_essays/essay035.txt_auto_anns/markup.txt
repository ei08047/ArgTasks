<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">High sales reflect power of advertising and not the real need

Nowadays, we can see advertisements everywhere, from television set to posters on the streets.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I tend to agree with this view.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most of the time, it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By which I mean, huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By casting famous singers in their television advertisement, motorcycles or clothes for example, sales increase significantly since youngsters, as the target consumers, love celebrities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since having these products shows their status, the quality obviously is not relatively important.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated, it is also true that it plays and important role economically.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable, since they aim to grab your attention.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The power of advertising maybe over-rated, we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No matter how <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">appealing</MPQAPOL> the advertisements are, we <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">able</MPQAPOL> to make the decision on our own.</MPQASENT>
