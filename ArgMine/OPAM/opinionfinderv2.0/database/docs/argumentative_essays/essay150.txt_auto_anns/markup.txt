<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Reading fictions is more pleasant

There are many different opinions regarding hobbies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some people would rather watch TV.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">However, in my view, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Firstly, fiction books pay more attention to details.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In fact, we can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Secondly, reading a novel is more convenient.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, I have started to read a novel since last week.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To sum up, reading <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">fictions</MPQAPOL> is more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">pleasant</MPQAPOL> because these books have more depth, are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">much</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">easier</MPQAPOL> to use, and more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">useful</MPQAPOL> for language learners.</MPQASENT>
