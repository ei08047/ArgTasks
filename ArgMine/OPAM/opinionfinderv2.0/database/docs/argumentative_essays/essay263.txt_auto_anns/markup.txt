<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whether it is better to have broad knowledge or not

Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some people believe that having a broad knowledge can give you a higher chance to success, while others think that professional in a specific subject is the key to enroll a success.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As far as I am concerned, having a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The following will present my points.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all, when one knows different region's works, it will help one to get a friend much easier.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, I worked in a large company, which has many different departments.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I was in the Management Information System department.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What we do every day is to solve the problem that our clients asked in the phone.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While some of the problems are the Engineering department's part, I went there and discussed with the colleagues there, since I have studied some of the engineering courses.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department, which made me popular there, and much easier to get the help that I need.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Second, when you want to translate your major, it is important to know some of the things about different fields.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Take my cousin Jeff and his friend as an example.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They majored in financing when they were in college.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But, they decided to enroll in the art system after graduated.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thanks to Jeff's hard working during his leisure time, he learned a lot about the history of art.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Things ended up that he joined in a great team, while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Although I agree with the idea that knowing different fields is important.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">People who hold different opinion may argue that if one can’t success one’s own major, what else things he can do in different filed.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Of course, it may be true when talking about this topic.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, what if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this way, it won’t be a problem at all.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether having the knowledge in different fields is better or not are carefully compared.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">best</MPQAPOL> choice is <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">obviously</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">stand</MPQAPOL> on my side, which is that a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">broad</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">knowledge</MPQAPOL> of different subjects is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">really</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">important</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
