<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">University education is needed for success

In today's modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nevertheless, I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First and foremost, it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Without proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Looking from another perspective, there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Take for instance those who start their own business.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These people depend solely on hard work and luck.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Interestingly, for some of them it proved to be a profitable job.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To cite an example, Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Initially, he started his computer company in his college dorm room.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Eventually, he used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition, people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To illustrate this further, David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hence, it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To wrap it all up, it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">However</MPQAPOL>, it <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> be <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">wrong</MPQAPOL> to say that one's <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">success</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">completely</MPQAPOL> depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Natural</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">talent</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">hard</MPQAPOL> work also contribute to their <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">progress</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
