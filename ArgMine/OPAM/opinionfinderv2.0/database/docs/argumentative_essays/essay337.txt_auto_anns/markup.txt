<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mobile phone; "Iron man" / "Weichat" - destroy social interactions?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Recently, there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Indeed, mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages, bringing convenience and entertainment into our life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, as far as I am concerned, I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the first place, spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the first place, as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones, they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore, there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as "Iron man".</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In those games, children are <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">rewarded</MPQAPOL> for being more <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">violent</MPQAPOL>, and this violence is repeated again and again.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instance, many games involve children <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">helping</MPQAPOL> their character to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">kill</MPQAPOL> or shoot, which many lead to increased <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">aggressive</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">feelings</MPQAPOL>, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">thoughts</MPQAPOL> and behaviours.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Therefore</MPQAPOL>, the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">hardship</MPQAPOL> of communication may be developed.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">However</MPQAPOL>, other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">rapid</MPQAPOL> development of the internet, people are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">able</MPQAPOL> to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">enjoy</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">quick</MPQAPOL> electronic communication via internet.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instance, as lots of chatting apps available online <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">such</MPQAPOL> as "Weichat", people tend to send instant messages <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">free</MPQAPOL> of charge by using their phones <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">rather</MPQAPOL> than face to face communication.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Therefore</MPQAPOL>, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After having <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">considered</MPQAPOL> all the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">problems</MPQAPOL> that I have discussed <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">above</MPQAPOL>, we can <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">finally</MPQAPOL> draw a conclusion that <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">although</MPQAPOL> mobile phones brings convenience of communication, they also contribute to some social <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">problems</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
