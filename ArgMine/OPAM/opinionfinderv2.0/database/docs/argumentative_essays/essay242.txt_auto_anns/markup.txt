<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, people should concern more about their living environment than job.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First, for most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, Workers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second, beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Without beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Even</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">though</MPQAPOL> local residents <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">benefits</MPQAPOL> from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories, they cannot <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">feel</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">happiness</MPQAPOL> from high-paying job yet because <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">most</MPQAPOL> of them <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">suffer</MPQAPOL> from <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">cancer</MPQAPOL> or other <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">diseases</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
