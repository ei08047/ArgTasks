The increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First of all, we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a result, criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus, citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, while on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, police force carries guns only in high crime societies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hence, people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Obviously, Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, from the above views, although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary, it will bring the higher level of violence.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Additionally, the government <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> to <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">impose</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">strict</MPQAPOL> laws in carrying weapons as <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">well</MPQAPOL> as give professional training to them in order to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">avoid</MPQAPOL> any <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">influence</MPQAPOL> on civilians' lives.</MPQASENT>
