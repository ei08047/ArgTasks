<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Schools should only teach children the academic subject

People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school, I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics because these subject are necessary for students' future.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is understandable when labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition, the unemployment rate is always high, so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although those above reasons are acceptable, I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, studying music, art or sports is also very important to students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, to get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For instance, through taking part in a sport, students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, these subjects might fulfil the students' ability.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally, children's future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school, it is the result of their efforts and capacity.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">although</MPQAPOL> the academic subjects play a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">primary</MPQAPOL> role in <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">nurturing</MPQAPOL> children, it <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">seem</MPQAPOL> to me that the effects of learning music, sports are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">profound</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
