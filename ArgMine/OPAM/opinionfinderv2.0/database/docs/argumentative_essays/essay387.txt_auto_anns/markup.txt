<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Life in Big Cities Vs People's health

Today, more and more people are moving to big cities to live.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, while life in those cities is good in some ways, I completely argue that people's health would therefore be affected negatively.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Exhaust from transportation, especially cars, and factories' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Besides, water pollution makes people's health become more critical.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people's bodies and create severe problems, which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today's market.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Also, overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases, especially cough, sneezing and illness.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore, living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary, pickpocketing, trickery, vandalism, smuggling or even murder.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Earning money for living becomes more difficult, living healthy in such places is getting harder also.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">believe</MPQAPOL> that life in <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">big</MPQAPOL> cities can have <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">negative</MPQAPOL> effects on people's health.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Thus</MPQAPOL>, both government and individual <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> take steps to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">diminish</MPQAPOL> the consequences involved.</MPQASENT>
