<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Type of temper and advantages of individual work as best arguments in favor of studying alone

Study achievements depend on a range of various factors, one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In particular, we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As for me, I favor the latter because of the following reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To begin with, type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Being by nature introvert, I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Once, when I was working on presentation with strangers, I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore/moreover, working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In other words, I must not divide tasks and duties between team members, share responsibility and benefits, and spend time on teambuilding.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To my rivals' surprise, being the only member of my own "team" I gained a victory.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, from my <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">point</MPQAPOL> of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">view</MPQAPOL>, type of <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">temper</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advantages</MPQAPOL> of individual work are the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">most</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">persuasive</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">arguments</MPQAPOL> in <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">favor</MPQAPOL> of studying alone.</MPQASENT>
