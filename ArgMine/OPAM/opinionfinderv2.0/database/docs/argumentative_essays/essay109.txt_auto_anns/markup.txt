<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Amount of control on media information

Nowadays, one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers, televisions and websites.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They have a serious impact on people in their puberty.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For example, an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is actually very environmentally unfriendly.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In other words, the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Even so, another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Both sides of the arguments have its merits.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My personal <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">view</MPQAPOL> is that <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">despite</MPQAPOL> the emphasis of citizen safety, the government <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> regulate the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">correct</MPQAPOL> amount of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">violent</MPQAPOL> and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">could</MPQAPOL> be a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">practical</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">idea</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
