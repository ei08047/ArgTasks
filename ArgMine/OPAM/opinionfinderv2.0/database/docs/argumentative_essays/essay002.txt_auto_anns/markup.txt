<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">More people are migrating to other countries than ever before

The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Secondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hence, it is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">clear</MPQAPOL> that keeping the cultural <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">traditions</MPQAPOL> in the destination countries is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">tremendous</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">important</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To conclude, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">although</MPQAPOL> there are <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">opposing</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">ideas</MPQAPOL> of <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">neglecting</MPQAPOL> one’s cultural <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">values</MPQAPOL> to adapt in the new cultures.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As far as I am <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">concerned</MPQAPOL>, sustaining the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">traditions</MPQAPOL> will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">confident</MPQAPOL> among the many culture society.</MPQASENT>
