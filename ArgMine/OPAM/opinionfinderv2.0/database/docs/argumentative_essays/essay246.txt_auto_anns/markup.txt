<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Haste makes waste

This saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, this statement is completely true, for these few reasons:
For one thing, making a quick decision means that it's not very thought out, and that it hasn't been checked from all its aspects.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Consequently, making quick decisions leads to probable bad results.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example: if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative, or a plan B, he could end up being unemployed, because of his speedy decision.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition, making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In another word, if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn't have missed out on the job opening in the same firm, but at a different position.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hence, he wouldn't have been unemployed.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not to mention, that hasty decisions, not only goes to waste, but also, could affect the entire life of the person.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To put it differently, is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed, he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs, thus, his life had taken a turn to the worst.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As can be seen from this, is that a hurried decision is almost never a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">good</MPQAPOL> one.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That's why one <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> always study his decision carefully and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">slowly</MPQAPOL>, to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">ensure</MPQAPOL> that the decision that the person is making is the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">best</MPQAPOL> for him.</MPQASENT>
