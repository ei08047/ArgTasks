<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">More convincing

There is a hotly debated issue over whether face-to-face communication is better than other kinds of communication, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people tend to believe that communication in person is the best way of expression, while others seem to stand on the opposite position.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I favor the former; that is, I agree that face-to-face communication is better.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that communicating in person can be more convincing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sometimes, face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully, and a fitting example can be found from my uncle.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He once complained a service of a restaurant.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Without exaggeration, he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Afterward, my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone, I do not think this problem would be thought important.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally crucible aspect is that it is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instance, I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend, Eric.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I just shocked and did not know what happened.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally, I realized that his facebook account was stolen.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that communication by letters, email, or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple, which is also one of the most important parts in communication.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is conceivable that before we talk, it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication; in contrast, it is usually detrimental to us.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I prefer to express my opinion in person because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In other words, I think the best way of communication is by means of face-to-face.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Still</MPQAPOL>, I am <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">firmly</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">convinced</MPQAPOL> that the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL> I proposed in <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">favor</MPQAPOL> of my own <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">sentiment</MPQAPOL> are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">much</MPQAPOL> more tenable and <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">cogent</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
