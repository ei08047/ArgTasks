<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives

There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students, I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the following, I will state my reasons for this choice.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First, when students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a case in point, more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a result, they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second, it would improve students' social behavior.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Thus, if they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As a matter of fact, when a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my viewpoint, concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">All in all, I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Students <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">improve</MPQAPOL> their social <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">positions</MPQAPOL> and encounter their <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">problems</MPQAPOL> in <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">positive</MPQAPOL> ways and also <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">intend</MPQAPOL> in the more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">confidence</MPQAPOL> manner and etc.</MPQASENT>
