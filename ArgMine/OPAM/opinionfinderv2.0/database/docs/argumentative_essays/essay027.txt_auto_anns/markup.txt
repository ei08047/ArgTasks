<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Financial aid to develop countries

As is commonly understood, there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, education is an essential part in development.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instance, most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">From this example, it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus, the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition, it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Indeed, they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And it has been <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">proven</MPQAPOL> that developing education and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">improving</MPQAPOL> national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">really</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">want</MPQAPOL> to alter current situation.</MPQASENT>
