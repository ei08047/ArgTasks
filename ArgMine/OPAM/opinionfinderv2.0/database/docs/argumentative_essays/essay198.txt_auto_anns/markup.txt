<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Improve roads or public transports

Many people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First, the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Cars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the contrary, if the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second, public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Averagely, public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Last but not least, using public transportation is much safer than private transportation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">According to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In short, I can say for <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">certain</MPQAPOL> that spending money on <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">improving</MPQAPOL> public transportation is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">necessary</MPQAPOL> because it is the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">key</MPQAPOL> to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">protect</MPQAPOL> our world, creating a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">healthy</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">safe</MPQAPOL> environment for people to live in.</MPQASENT>
