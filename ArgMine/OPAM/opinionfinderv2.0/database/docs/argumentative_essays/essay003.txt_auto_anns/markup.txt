<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">International tourism is now more common than ever before

The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country’s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely ‘Trong Dong’ drum performance and ‘Ha Long’ bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Without this <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">support</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">profit</MPQAPOL> from tourism, many <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">traditional</MPQAPOL> cultures <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> disappear due to its <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">low</MPQAPOL> income works.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Thus</MPQAPOL>, tourism has <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">survived</MPQAPOL> many non-tangible cultural <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">values</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">beauty</MPQAPOL> scenes.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To conclude, as far as I am <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">concerned</MPQAPOL>, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">values</MPQAPOL> of the tourist countries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition, the authorities <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> adequately <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">support</MPQAPOL> these <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">sustainable</MPQAPOL> developments.</MPQASENT>
