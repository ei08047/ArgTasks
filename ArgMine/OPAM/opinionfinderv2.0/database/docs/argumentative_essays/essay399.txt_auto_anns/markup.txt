<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Drugs, alcohol and messy sex lives

Celebrities, for example movie stars, are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend, etc.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is human nature that people, especially youngsters, are attracted to the celebrities they favour, and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Further more, they will not value other people's hard work and take everything for granted.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Meanwhile, not all celebrities are role models.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols, having messy sex lives.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Worse still, without proper parenting, children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Of course, some celebrities, e.g. writers, passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children for they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, media should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Meanwhile, children's access to the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">celebrities</MPQAPOL> news on the media <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">restricted</MPQAPOL> and they <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> study only from the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">celebrities</MPQAPOL> who can act <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">positively</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
