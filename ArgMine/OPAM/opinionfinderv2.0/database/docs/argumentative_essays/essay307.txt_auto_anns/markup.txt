<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Famous people are bothered by the media

Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Others believe that television, newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This issue is a controversial one, but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples' lives in order to increase their audience or readership.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thanks to the Internet, we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don't need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nowadays, unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Additionally, there are Reality TV, television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations, for example like "Big Brother".</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To sum up, it is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">clear</MPQAPOL> that television, magazines and newspapers pay <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">too</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">much</MPQAPOL> attention of peoples' private lives for all the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL> mentioned <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">above</MPQAPOL>, namely to increase audience or readership and to give <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">exciting</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">shocking</MPQAPOL> news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV.</MPQASENT>
