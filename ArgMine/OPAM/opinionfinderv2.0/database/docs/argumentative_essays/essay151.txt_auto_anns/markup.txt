Today, English is commonly used language across the world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Its usage is increasing day by day.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As a consequence, various local languages are becoming extinct.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some people argue that, this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, I believe using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Due to globalization, many people are traveling for professional trips.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So, communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore, students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Adding to that, exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics, medical, astronomy etc would become easier.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, few people are worried about the dying local languages.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They represent local culture.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As the usage of these languages decrease, culture also changes accordingly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Further</MPQAPOL>, these languages are tightly coupled with history; all the olden day literature and scripts will be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">impossible</MPQAPOL> to decipher if these languages are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">lost</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To conclude, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">believe</MPQAPOL> change is <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">inevitable</MPQAPOL> and that usage of one language across the world is a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">positive</MPQAPOL> one.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We have to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">accept</MPQAPOL> these changes for a world to be a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">better</MPQAPOL> place.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Communication in single language <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">improve</MPQAPOL> the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page.</MPQASENT>
