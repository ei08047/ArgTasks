<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Machines - positive or negative for humans

Advancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These machines reduce the physical work done by humans.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans.<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On other side of the coin, many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After analyzing these two points of view, it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Therefore</MPQAPOL>, it is <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">hoped</MPQAPOL> that in coming time people will <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">enjoy</MPQAPOL> using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">disease</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">free</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
