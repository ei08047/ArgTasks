<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Gun control 

Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">considering</MPQAPOL> the rise in accident rates, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">violent</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">crime</MPQAPOL> rates and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">suicide</MPQAPOL> rates, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">support</MPQAPOL> that the guns <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">strictly</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">limited</MPQAPOL> and the government <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.</MPQASENT>
