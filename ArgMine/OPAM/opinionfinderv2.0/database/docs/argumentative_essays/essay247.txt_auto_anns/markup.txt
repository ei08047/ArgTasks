<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">People are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time

Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example in relationships.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition, cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, they are more flexible.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally, the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Travelling, social life and employment are highly <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">dependent</MPQAPOL> on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">flexible</MPQAPOL> than an own car.</MPQASENT>
