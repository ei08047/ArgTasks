<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Government shouldn't put money on building theaters or sports stadiums

How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Recently, some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a matter of fact, an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Entertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Instead, the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore, putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To summarize, I strongly <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">agree</MPQAPOL> that budgets <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be allocated more on medical care and education <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">rather</MPQAPOL> than on building <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">entertaining</MPQAPOL> facilities, because the former is more <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">essential</MPQAPOL>, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.</MPQASENT>
