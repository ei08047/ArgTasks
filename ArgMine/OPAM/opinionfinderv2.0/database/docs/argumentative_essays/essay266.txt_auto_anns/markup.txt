<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits

Advertising is becoming part of our modern society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They penetrate into people's life, affecting people's choices in different things.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people's life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits, while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people's judgments.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all, advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people's concept of wholesome diets and self-control.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, advertising is not the only information source for people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second, in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle, some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In other words, advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In these cases, the advertising industry bolsters people's awareness of having a healthy lifestyle.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Besides, advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">inevitable</MPQAPOL> to be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">exposed</MPQAPOL> to the environment <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">full</MPQAPOL> of advertisements but it does not <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">mean</MPQAPOL> that our <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">right</MPQAPOL> to choose is taken away.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We will always be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">able</MPQAPOL> to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">decide</MPQAPOL> our own lifestyles.</MPQASENT>
