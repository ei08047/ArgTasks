<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I'm against providing more money to professors

University education is always an important part of one's life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That's why education in university is discussed all the time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What is the best way to orientate the students?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Raising the salaries of professors so?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I would say no.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The professors are essential, however, the schools are established for students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The following are my opinions.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To begin with, the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It's unpleasant to stay at school.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Besides, the ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In addition, will the university filter all the professors overall?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some professors don't deserve the money at all, then, what's the point to spend money on them?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There won't be any effect if school does so.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was news about raising professors' salary in my country.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At school, students are priority.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That's the main <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reason</MPQAPOL> I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">against</MPQAPOL> providing more money to professors.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Students are those who <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">suppose</MPQAPOL> to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">enjoy</MPQAPOL> the use of their tuition.</MPQASENT>
