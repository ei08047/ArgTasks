<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people believe that there should be fixed punishment for each crime type

Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions, that forces to a person to be a criminal.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Secondly, laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance "a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women, who steals for her drug addiction".</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the contrary, fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Everyone <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be treated equally because sometimes we see that a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">poor</MPQAPOL> person who do not have <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">much</MPQAPOL> money for hiring a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">good</MPQAPOL> lawyer they get <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">imprisoned</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">even</MPQAPOL> without committing a <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">crime</MPQAPOL> and when they come back to the society they become a professional <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">criminal</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Therefore</MPQAPOL> fixed punishment will reduce the space between <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">poor</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">rich</MPQAPOL> people and everyone will <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">understand</MPQAPOL> the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">importance</MPQAPOL> of each other.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To conclude, Government <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">decide</MPQAPOL> for punishment case by case basis.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In doing <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">so</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">crime</MPQAPOL> can be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">eliminated</MPQAPOL> from a nation and it is a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">responsibility</MPQAPOL> of every individual to be in the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">favor</MPQAPOL> of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">truth</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">respect</MPQAPOL> the laws of our constitution.</MPQASENT>
