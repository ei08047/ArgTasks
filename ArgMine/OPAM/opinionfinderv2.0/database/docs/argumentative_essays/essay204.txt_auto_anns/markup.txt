<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom

During these digital age, the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Almost every school develops their online class systems.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Although, online classes have many advantages, for me, I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First, the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Consequently, the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate's ideas.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second, classroom learning provides other activities than studying.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">During student's free time, they have a number of activities that they can join, such as playing sports, going to lab, or going to library.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These activities lead to more interact with their friends.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities, furthermore, they have a chance to learn about their societies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">While the online course keeps the children at their home only.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Lastly, in school, there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The professor provides good answers to you.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They do not mind helping you, and they never leave you alone when you got a problem.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In contrast, in distance learning, these aspects of the professor had reduced their important.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The professor has been assigned to teach only.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, traditional learning still has many benefits to the students.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But in the future, it <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">seems</MPQAPOL> that the distance learning become more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">popular</MPQAPOL> and ordinary in schools.</MPQASENT>
