<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The importance of games for adults comparing to children

As people grow up, the arguments about the importance of games arise.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some people think that, adults need playing games as children do.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, in my opinion, games are no longer too important for them for several reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But, more often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, and as a result, they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, in my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, my younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In fact, a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Because of that, they no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">To sum up, I think adults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Along with the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">high</MPQAPOL> requirement for family and work, games are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">just</MPQAPOL> some leisure activities for adults, not something <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">necessary</MPQAPOL> as they are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">meant</MPQAPOL> to be for children.</MPQASENT>
