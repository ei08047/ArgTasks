When choosing a job, one need to consider it thoroughly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents' job or not, different people may hold different opinions.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As far as I am concerned, I think choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First of all, as parents are involved in the same environment, they could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, my father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Because he has many experiences, I could save enormous time in finding solution.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nevertheless, since parents have worked in tens of years, they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instance, they know which company has better welfare or provides better education.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some may argue that as time is different, the condition of job market is completely different.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, choosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I agree with this opinion to some extent, but when it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash, so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents', I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">believe</MPQAPOL> parents can lead their children to a more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">smooth</MPQAPOL> career path.</MPQASENT>
