Learning to be independent is essential for young adults.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In my point of view, staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My opinion is based on creating memories with parents, saving money, and taking advice from parents.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First of all, one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus, I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, living at home costs less than living outside.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In a word, the parents can save money, if their children live with them longer.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother's suggestions.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If the parents do not <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">help</MPQAPOL> him <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">immediately</MPQAPOL>, he <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> have to <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">suffer</MPQAPOL> more <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">pain</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hence, taking <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advice</MPQAPOL> from parents, the young adult can go through <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">obstacles</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">easily</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
