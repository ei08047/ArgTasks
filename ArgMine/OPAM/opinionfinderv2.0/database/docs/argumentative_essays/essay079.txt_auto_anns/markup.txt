<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Government should spend money on ARTs, not only on public services

As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years, they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a result, some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, from my perspective, I think arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Admittedly, the government should give priority to public services and facilities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Simultaneously, public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand, I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Individually, arts can enrich people's cultural lives.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Consequently, they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From the point of the local community, funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">means</MPQAPOL> preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">helps</MPQAPOL> the local people have a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">sense</MPQAPOL> of belonging but also contributes to the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">booming</MPQAPOL> local tourism industry.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">view</MPQAPOL>, arts serve cultural and economic purposes.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With those <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">arguments</MPQAPOL> in mind, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> conclude that public services and facilities are an <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">integral</MPQAPOL> part of the government expenditure.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At the same time, the authorities <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> also <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">respect</MPQAPOL> the value of arts which are individually and socially <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advantageous</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
