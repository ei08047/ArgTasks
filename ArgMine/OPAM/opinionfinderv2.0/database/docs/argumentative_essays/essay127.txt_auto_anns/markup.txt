<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology

The life today is totally different from half centuries before.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems; however it also deprives of some things that we had.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The first reason is life is simple in the past.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nowadays, all humans compete together.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since world population getting higher, competition is getting fierce.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you are not able to handle your jobs, then someone will replace you right away.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore, lives in the old days is easier than today.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second, the environment today is serious damaged.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Looking out the windows, what I see isn't sky, trees or mountains, but is coldly high buildings.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Everyday, I walk on hard roads, breath in polluted air, and live in a limited space.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What's worse, it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus, the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The third reason is that the pace of life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Today, we are able to read the news all over the world, to chat with people through the Internet, or to travel around the world by planes; however, it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If we cannot react properly and immediately, then we will be in a vulnerable situation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, while there some people live in a pretty good condition, it is only a minority.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">People are put <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">too</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">much</MPQAPOL> focus on making wealth and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">progress</MPQAPOL> in technology; <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">nevertheless</MPQAPOL>, behind the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">glamorous</MPQAPOL> facade of it, what we <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">loss</MPQAPOL> will never be returned.</MPQASENT>
