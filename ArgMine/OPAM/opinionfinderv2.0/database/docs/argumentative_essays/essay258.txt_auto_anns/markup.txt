<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own

Different people prefer different styles of learning.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the other hand, sometimes I would rather learning on my own.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available, I get discouraged after spending a lot of time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this situation, I'll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won't get discouraged and confused.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example, if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming, you'll have to find a teacher.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It's almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By the way, if you are going to learn some things by yourself, you may learn and understand them incorrectly!</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, from my own experiences, after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher, I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo, but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits, I was able to play properly.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won't have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In today's world there are many <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">great</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">useful</MPQAPOL> sources available like books, electronic books, the internet and TV and satellite.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I can utilize them as tutorials for many things.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For instance, I can learn English or other languages by a lot of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">helpful</MPQAPOL> books and many online websites.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In sum, sometimes it is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">good</MPQAPOL> to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In my <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">view</MPQAPOL>, both can <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">help</MPQAPOL> and each of them has its own <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">advantages</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">disadvantages</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
