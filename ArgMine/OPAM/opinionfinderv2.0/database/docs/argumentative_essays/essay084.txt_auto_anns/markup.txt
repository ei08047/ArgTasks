<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Giving mobile phones to the unemployed

Today, the rate of unemployment is on the rise and is seriously being debated by many.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nevertheless, I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In a positive point of view, when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet, they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, they can surf the The Star Onlines' work section to find a job that is suitable for them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With the help of the net, they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not only that, the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In short, if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone, they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nonetheless, looking from another perspective, supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers' money.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To illustrate this further, the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To conclude, the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore, when hand phones are provided for free, many would want to take advantage of this opportunity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone, they make themselves jobless.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this context, the public's money is spent worthlessly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On top of that, till now, there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To put it in a nutshell, the suggestion of providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I suggest the government look into the background of the people in depth before giving out hand phones to them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I strongly <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">believe</MPQAPOL> that the public money <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be utilized for the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">benefit</MPQAPOL> of the society and not <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">just</MPQAPOL> for some of them who are not <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">willing</MPQAPOL> to put in more effort to find them a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">proper</MPQAPOL> work.</MPQASENT>
