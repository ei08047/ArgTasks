<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There will be soon no role for teachers in classrooms

In recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">However, I do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, computers need to be operated by people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers, but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Secondly, children need human interactions.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a recent interview with Josh Trumm â€“ the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Without someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn'.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I am inclined to agree with this scientific view, because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, there can be no school without a teacher.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Teachers are not <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">just</MPQAPOL> teachers, they are also <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">friends</MPQAPOL> and conseilieurs.</MPQASENT>
