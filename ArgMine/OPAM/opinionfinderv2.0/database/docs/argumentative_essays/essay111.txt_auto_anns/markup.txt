<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Testing on animals and keeping them in unnatural conditions

Perhaps the most serious problem facing the animals' rights today is animal experimentation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing, including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health, I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Firstly, the costs outweigh the benefits.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Every year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money, since they must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secondly, animals are kept in unnatural conditions.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Consequently, I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading, since animals and people's response to a drug can be different.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL> mentioned <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">above</MPQAPOL>, it <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">seems</MPQAPOL> to me that testing on animals has no <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">clear</MPQAPOL> result and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">consequently</MPQAPOL>, it <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> be made <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">illegal</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
