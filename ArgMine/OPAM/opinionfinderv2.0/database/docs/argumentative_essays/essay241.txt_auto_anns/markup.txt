<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Life in  a city is much better than life in the countryside

As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Firstly, in the city there is much better education system.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This means, that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition, I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There are not only more jobs, but they are also well-paid.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Of course living in a city is more expensive, but incomes are higher too.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreover, in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means, that the culture diversity is huge.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Meeting and knowing new people's tradition is an unforgettable experience, which could influence on one's previous habits.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, the city has well-organised lines of transport.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside, so the city provides better communication.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, in the countryside there are many places to rest, because of its location.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover, peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Taking all into account, I think that living in the city is much better nowadays, because of the opportunities it gives.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle, which for me is without perspective.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">could</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">decide</MPQAPOL> I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> chose living in the city for <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">sure</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
