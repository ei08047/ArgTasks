Nowadays transportation has attracted much social concern.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Both these two things are important.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First and foremost, carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Whereas, if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Obviously, the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition, the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In order to tackle the problem, governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In conclusion, I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nevertheless, public transportation systems even have more important advantages.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities.</MPQASENT>
