I believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The following are my reasons.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the first place, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Here is a positive example: Queens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I found that I could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As far as I am concerned, a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lastly, it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Accordingly, with sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition, the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For the above-mentioned <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL>, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">advocate</MPQAPOL> building a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">big</MPQAPOL> shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">beneficial</MPQAPOL> to our community.</MPQASENT>
