Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children's education.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Indeed, children grow up with two important people, their parents and teachers, and both are important in children's development.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As far as I am concerned, I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the first place, school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instance, to be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However, in comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example, after many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By contrast, parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Last but not least, compared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work, hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus, it was impossible for them to be a good teacher.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion, teachers are the best for children's education.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not only do they contribute <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">much</MPQAPOL> to children's professional <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">skills</MPQAPOL> but also they can teach their students <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">important</MPQAPOL> social communication techniques in order to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">survive</MPQAPOL> in this <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">competitive</MPQAPOL> world.</MPQASENT>
